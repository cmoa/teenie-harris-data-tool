Fire - Thirteen persons, including Mr. and Mrs. Robert Whittington, two daughters and sons-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Love and Mr. and Mrs. James Williams, and seven grandchildren lost their home at 1502 Brushton Avenue Saturday morning when fire raged through this house destroying all their possessions.
