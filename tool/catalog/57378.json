They have played successful engagements at many of the city's top clubs.  Presently they have two crazy records going : \"Ultra\" and \"that's All That Matters to Me.\"  To be released in near future are \"Swat Mist\" and \"I Want a Little Girl,\" all on the Moss label.  That's Flo Cassinelli on the tenor sax; Don Mastri, bass; Bob Negri, piano, and Spider Rondinelli, drums. - Harris PHoto.\"",
