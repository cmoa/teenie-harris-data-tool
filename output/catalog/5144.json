(Gus) Greenlee, who died at his home here Monday after being ill for the past two years. Men, women and children displayed it in same manner that this customer at the now burned-out Crawford Grill is showing in this photo.  The folks on top remembered when 'Gus' helped them during the depression while they couldn't aid themselves.  The folks who weren't hitting it so well depended on him for many a touch.  That's how 'Gus' made and lost several fortunes...by 'being a friend to man.' - Harris Photo.\"",
