The youngsters journeyed sixty miles to the Ligonier (Pa.) High School just to watch the champ in action.  So anxious were they to go, each cancelled elaborate plans that had been made for them to attend the circus.  When Charles heard his he broke a role and posed with them.  Left to right: Ethel Holt, Jacqueline Holyfield, Chestina Mallory, Barbara Jackson, Ernestine Allen, Johnnie Allen and Donald Smith. - Harris Photo.\"",
