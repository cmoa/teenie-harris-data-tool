First, the 6' 8\" athlete signed a contract to play professional basketball for the St. Louis Hawks at a salary said to call for $10,000 a year.  Saturday he was married to his college sweetheart, pretty Margaret Ellen Mount, in Pittsburgh, and Sunday he was graduated from Duquesne.  It's figured Ricketts will sign a baseball contract sometime this week.  He pitches and plays first.  Dandy Dick is shown watching his bride accept congratulations from Lou (Doc) Skender, Duquesne Athletic director and baseball coach.  Dudley Moore, basketball coach, far left, look on approvingly. - Harris Photo.\"\n\nCutline for related image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 11, 1955, pg. 11, reads:  \"Leaving the church - Mr. and Mrs. Richard J.
