For more than fifty years a peaceful, interracial community, in recent years the Homewood-Brushton District has been gradually shifting; becoming more and more the home of Negro families.  In recent months, with the announcement that the better part of at least seven blocks occupied by white rental tenants was being sold to Negroes by one real estate company alone, complaints began to reach The Courier as to the manner in which white families were being put out of the homes bought by Negroes and from Negro families about the high prices and terms of sale of many real estate outfits selling homes.  That all is not exactly calm in Homewood-Brushton area is reflected by the writings on two sides of a pillar of the Pittsburgh Railways Company Shops at the main corner of Homewood-Brushton, Homewood and Frankstown Avenues, where Frankstown Avenue and Ardmore trolley riders transfer to the Homewood-Penn Township and Squirrel Hill bus.  The pictures at the top of this page show both sides of the same pillar.  The side carrying words derogatory to and hated by Negroes appeared first.  Then the side of the pillar carrying racial epithets sometimes hurled at whites appeared as a sort of answer.  Another indication that the community balance is being shifted towards Negroes is the seven or eight stores on Homewood Avenue that are vacant or which bear signs that they are moving to other neighborhoods in a period in which Pittsburgh's businessmen are going through one of the biggest eras of prosperity ever to hit the city.  Yet stores which formerly catered to more whites than Negroes are moving.  All of the stores pictured here have moved or are going to move.  A white funeral parlor at the corner of Race Street and Homewood Avenue which moved Aug. 1 is not pictured.  This could have been added to the many moving to other sections.  If city-wide prosperity does not make business stay on Homewood Avenue, then the state of business on Homewood Avenue does not make them leave either.  It must be something else.  One business leader says: 'Most of the businessmen of Homewood Avenue welcome the influx of Negroes into the community.  Doubling up by Negroes in order to pay high prices for single family homes, swells the population of the community, and as a result they supermarkets and other stores are packed to the doors daily with customers.'\"",

Robert L. Vann' in memory of the late lawyer, politician, humanitarian, and publisher under whose leadership The Pittsburgh Courier became the biggest and most influential Negro newspaper, extant. 'The launching of the Robert L. Vann - sixth Liberty ship to be named for an outstanding Negro - marks another epoch in the annals of American history.' Mr. Spaulding said.  Robert L. Vann was a leader, a statesman, an organizer a publisher of note, and my personal friend,' the insurance magnate continued.  'I repeat that he was such an organizer that The Courier, which he edited and controlled for 30 years, has been so successfully managed since his passing that the circulation has been increased from 170,000 to 255,000 under the leadership of his comrade and successor, Ira F. Lewis, and his devoted companion, Mrs. Robert L. Vann, who stood so nobly by the late humanitarian during his brilliant career.  'Both his ideas and ideals will be carried forward by this, the S.S. Robert L. Vann, as it plows the sea, as well as by his successors in the great Courier family.  The naming of the six ships for outstanding Negroes has done more to inspire and encourage Negro Americans than any other act of the National Maritime commission.  My congratulations and God bless you all.'

The waitress, Grace Smith, 32, 5475 Hillcrest Street, tearfully pleaded guilty of refusing the two men, by said that she had received no instructions from the proprietor, Peter Hatzidais, to do so.  'She Refused on Her Own'  At the hearing, Mr. Hatzidais repeated in testimony what Alderman Fitzgerald said Hatzidais had told him in a telephone conversation several days before the trial: 'I serve everybody in my restaurant and always have.  If she refused these men service, she did it on her own initiative and I don't have any sympathy for her.  She'll take her own consequences, I make my own roles as to policy in my restaurant and discrimination has never been one of my regulations.  Miss Smith had that she had only worked ten weeks at the restaurant, that she had been employed before that by Dempsey and Rand's restaurant, Sheridan Avenue, East Liberty, and that there she was not permitted to serve Negroes upon threat of loss of her job.  She said she had been a waitress for twelve years and had found a similar policy on other jobs.  Alderman Fitzgerald asked the youths if they were willing to withdraw the case upon payment of the costs by Hatzidais and Miss Smith, which was done.  Alderman Fitzgerald said that he had received several telephone calls from Homestead business men about...[illegible] Arthur Harris, 2[?]31 Centre Avenue, and Major Ponder, 1814 Enoch Street, brought the suit.\"",
