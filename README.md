#Teenie Harris Data Tool

Build off the TeenieWeek of Play to use automation and machine learning techniques to significantly improve the Teenie Harris metadata. Create and refine code created during the initial week of experimentation, so that it can be applied to a large portion of the Teenie Archive and imported into EMu.
