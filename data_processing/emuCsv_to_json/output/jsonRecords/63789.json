A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"Newspapers, today, still exert a great influence on public opinion.  One field is politics where they help you to vote for the right man.  Newspapers are not influenced by various things and tell the truth today as they did in the past.\"",
