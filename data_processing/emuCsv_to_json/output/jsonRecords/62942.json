	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. C.C. Murray, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 18, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should immediately enforce the Supreme Court's recent decision in 'Little Rock School Case' or permit the recalcitrant states to take their time in obeying?\" answer reads: \"I think it should be left up to the states. If the states after a certain amount of time, can't accomplish what it should, then the Federal Government should step in and enforce the law.  So far as Little Rock is concerned, I think that they should be given about two weeks.  Then, if there is no satisfactory settlement, the Federal Government should step in.\"",
