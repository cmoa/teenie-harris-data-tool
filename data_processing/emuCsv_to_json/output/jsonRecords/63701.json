A1 with question: \"Do you think that the hospital service rendered under Blue Cross plan is worth its present cost to the subscriber? Do you think the rates should be raised?  Why?\"  answer reads: \"No, I don't think that they are.  I think that, perhaps they are abusing the income from the program.  There are a lot of cases in which the doctors are over-charging because the people have Blue Cross coverage.  As to whether or not the rates should be raised, I can't say because I don't know about them.\"",
