	"CatDescriptText": "Grace Jackson, department store employee, 6202 Penn Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 15, 1959, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"I would say that in the case of a teen-ager, I don't think that there should be the death penalty. The reason I say this is because I know a person, who at the age of 16, committed first-degree murder and served about 30 to 35 years in jail.  When he completed his term, he returned to society and has made a successful rehabilitation.  I think that an adult guilty of first-degree murder should receive just what he deserves.  I think that the judge knows what is the proper sentence, and in most cases, hands out the proper one.\"",
