Parents gathered for that last-minute farewell to their sons.  Paul M. Dykes, youth secretary, and Lou Davenport, a member of the youth committee, accompanied the boys.  Many interesting spots were visited on the 24-hour trip, which included a sightseeing tour of Canada, outing at Belle Isle, swimming at the St. Antoine Branch YMCA, and meals.  This as an annual bus-trip activity, sponsored for members of the Summer Fun Club.  A different city of interest is selected each summer. - Harris Photo.\"",
