	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Byron N. Peters, real estate office receptionist, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 28, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\" answer reads: \"There is a great difference, and it is for the worse.  I think that the negligence of the parents towards their children is a very important reason for the worsening of the moral conditions.  Children today, have more freedom than those of yesterday and this is bad, because they don't have the counsel and guidance which are so necessary for their well-being.\"",
