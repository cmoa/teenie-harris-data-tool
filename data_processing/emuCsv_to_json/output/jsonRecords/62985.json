A1 with question: \"Which of these sources of leadership do you believe Negroes generally follow: church, labor, or politics? Why?\" answer reads: \"I think that we follow politics.  It seems as though everything is done for politics and the people seem to go along with the trend and to follow it.  Some of them go for what they can get from politics, but in my opinion, the majority of them go by hearsay and not by the actual facts.\"",
