A1 with question: \"Do you approve of teachers paddling children?\"  Ms. Pointor's answer reads: \"Paddling really doesn't teach the children anything.  You are punishing them.  The best way is to take something away from them, like a recess period or keep them after school.\"  Ms. Smith's answer reads: \"They shouldn't paddle the students, but refer the children to their respective parents.  If the parents do not act, then some punishment should be taken.\"",
