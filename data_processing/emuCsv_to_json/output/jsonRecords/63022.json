If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"No, I really don't.  I just do not believe that one person has the right to take the life of another.  There are many other effective ways of punishment.  Sentencing persons to death penalty does not deter similar brutal crimes.\"",
