	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Robert (Bob) Wooden, city patrolman, 2137 Wylie Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 28, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"What do you think of race relations here in Pittsburgh?\" Answer reads: \"The overall race relations ple-ture [sic] in Pittsburgh seems to be very good. An example of racial progress is the integrated housing project on the South Side.  And I would say that the Housing Authority's actions in general has had a lot to do with the lessening of racial friction.  I don't know of any areas in Pittsburgh where race relations are extremely bad.  I guess the reason is that most Negroes like to keep among their kind.  And we're almost as much to blame as others for lack of extremely outstanding success in interracial areas.  As for living conditions, the greater movement of Negroes into other neighborhoods, I don't know what could be done, because there seems to be a subtle agreement to keep Negroes from buying there.  That's even if you have the money.\"",
