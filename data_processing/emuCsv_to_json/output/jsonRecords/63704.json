	"CatDescriptText": "Whit Gallman, florist, 1508 Oberlin Street was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  By reporting on the campaign of the Greater Pittsburgh Improvement League to get Negro clerks in two large grocery chains.  The example of how newspapers influence public opinion.  It was through these reports that I learned of the campaign and participated in the boycott...I definitely do not think that newspapers are as free as they should be.  If something happens to an influential person who does not want it reported, he sees somebody at the paper and the news is not carried, or if it is carried, it's not reported as it should be.  I know this to be true from experience, because I had something which would have rocked the neighborhood, but it was withheld from publication because of political influence and personal friendship.\"",
