John Thomas Sr. is the father...The rescue of the children was largely due to the quick action of a next-door neighbor, Harold Davis, who unreeled 130-foot of garden hose, which he uses to wash his car, and began to water down the flames in parts of the house where they were greatest before firemen arrived...\"",
