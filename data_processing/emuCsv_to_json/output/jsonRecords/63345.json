	"CatDescriptText": "Lucinda Pearson, 43 Noblestown Road, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 14, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the recreational facilities for young people in Pittsburgh are adequate? If not, what do you think should be done about it?\" answer reads: \"In one way, there are and in another way there are not adequate facilities.  In some sections of town there are places where Negro children are resented and it is very hard for them to go and play on the playgrounds.  And in 20th Ward where I live, there definitely are not adequate facilities for the children.  There is one ball field there and the children play basketball.  Other than that there are no organized facilities for recreation.  I think that the city should pay for the needed recreational facilities.\"",
