	"CatDescriptText": "Barbara Lewis, Junior at Sacred Heart High School, 1110 DeVictor Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 12, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Should well defined courses in sex education be taught in the public school system? If so, at what grade should the teaching of these courses begin?\" answer reads: \"Why not ask a teenager instead of talking to all adults on this question?  Speaking as one, I say that I don't believe that it is necessary.  Around the sophomore year, we receive some instruction in biology.  I think that the main teachings of the facts of life should be done in the home.  For the teacher to stand up in class and tell everything would be embarrassing and not proper.  The children should be told by their parents.  The trouble today is that it seems as though the parents are afraid to tell their children about the facts of life, and this makes the teenager go wrong.  In several of the cases where the children went wrong, it has been discovered that they never were properly instructed.\"",
