Oliver, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 14, 1962, pg. 17 with question: \"Do you think it is ethical or right for a doctor to go on 'strike' as a protest?\"  Ms. Thomas' answer reads: \"A doctor should have more of an interest in humanity than just public recognition or money.  It's a part of his professional duty.\"  Mr. Brier's answer reads: \"No.  My reason?  My eight children.  Suppose my doctor went out on strike and one of my kids became ill.  If I could find a doctor, he would be a stranger who wouldn't be familiar with their case histories.  You have to have confidence in the sort of man who gives you medical attention.\"",
