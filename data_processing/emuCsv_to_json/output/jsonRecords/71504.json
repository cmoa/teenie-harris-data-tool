	"CatDescriptText": "Rev. Solomon White, minister, Penn Hills and Mr. Harry Wilson, porter, South Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, March 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Negroes over-emphasize \"social life\" as it pertains to entertainment?  If so, can you suggest a remedy for \"curing it.\" Rev. White's answer reads: \"I believe that Negroes place values upon entertainment in proportion to other values in life.  In other words, that is, in relation to what makes a well-rounded person.  I think they participate in their social groups.  I also feel that Negroes have other values than entertainment.  Negroes are no more interested in the 'good times' than any other group.  The emphasis Negroes place on social values is not out of proportion to that of any other social group.\"   Mr. Wilson's answer reads: \"No, I don't.  Although I'm an old man now, that's one thing I did as a young man and still do today.  The young should have fun, as long as they don't overdo it.\"",
