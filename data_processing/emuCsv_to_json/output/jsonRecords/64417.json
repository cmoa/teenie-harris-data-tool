	"CatDescriptText": "Norma Brown, housewife, Homewood and Robert Myer, messenger, Terrace Village, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 2, 1960, pg. 25 with question \"What is your opinion of the service rendered by the Pittsburgh Railways Company?  Do you think trolley fare rates should be increased?\"  Mrs. Brown's answer reads: \"It's not too bad, but on the other hand, it's not too good, because it is hard not too good, because it is hard to get into town, especially from Homewood.  After the holiday season, it probably won't be as bad.  As for a fare increase, well, twenty-five cents is enough for the street cars and thirty cents is sufficient for the buses.  When there is a raise in fare they usually take more trolleys out of service and there's not enough operating now.\"  Mr. Myer's answer reads: \"It is all right.  It's pretty good.  It gets you where you are going and takes care of the parking problem and is cheaper than bringing a car. I don't think there should be an increase in fares because they are high enough now.\"",
