	"CatDescriptText": "Betty Black, hotel employe, Herron Avenue and Paul Brownhill, salesman, Greentree, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, June 17, 1961, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you think that courses in race relations should be taught in the public schools?  If so, in what grade do you think they should be taught first?\" Mrs. Black's answer reads: \"I don't think it's necessary...Usually race relations are taught in the home by the parents.  In other words, whether or not the child gets along with others, depends on the parents and their views regarding race.\" Mr. Brownhill's answer reads: 'I say no.  I don't think such courses are necessary in public schools, because there's no race problem.  It seems as though you should not make an issue of this, and in that way the whole thing would be ignored, and we eventually it would work itself out.  It's not necessary in the North, especially in Pittsburgh.  In other parts of the country, it may be different.\"",
