Stone, the proprietor (center) used race ridicule to combat the picket. An extremely fat, dark, short-haired woman, attired in a flour sack, with a large chrysanthemum pinned on her lapel, began to walk up and down with the picket shortly after he appeared.  She had a sign which read, 'Just Married, On Our Honeymoon, Ain't Love Grand' pinned on her.  Complaints of Negroes and whites in vicinity against Proprietor Stone's 'stunt' caused quite a disturbance and brought about withdrawal of the fat woman shortly after she took up her march. - Harris Photo.\"",
