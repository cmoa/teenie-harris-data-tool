	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. James Wade, truck driver, Beltzhoover and Miss Elizabeth Pearson, housewife, Uptown, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 3, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that in custody cases a child should be awarded to the mother, even though she may be of questionable background?...Or do you think they should be placed in a foster home, with visiting privileges being granted to the parent?\" Mr. Wade's answer reads: \"I don't believe any child should be placed into a foster home.  In a few cases, they may be better off in a foster home.  But in the majority of cases, the child or children is better off with the mother.\"  Ms. Pearson's answer reads: \"If they know definitely that the background of the mother is not good they should put the child into a foster home or find a better home in some way.\"",
