	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Louise Payne, 3338 Webster Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 4, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you believe that Negro communities actually choose their leaders or do they accept the leadership, which 'the powers-that-be' select and 'hand' to them?\" answer reads: \"I believe that the Negro, in general, chooses his own leaders. I think that our young people today are thinking more for themselves and acting on their convictions.  They are not prone to be like our forebearers who accepted some things because somebody said so.  The young folk have to be convinced of an ideal before they will accept it.\"",
