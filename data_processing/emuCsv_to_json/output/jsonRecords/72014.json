	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Joseph Amma, butcher, Brookline, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 9, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"In your opinion, what do you think is the most effective protest medium Negro people have today?\" answer reads: \"I don't believe in sit-down strikes.  I do believe that if you have the proper organization and leadership you will reach the objectives.  I don't think you are receiving proper leadership.  You have so many good leaders, and you don't see them going out and getting into mischief and being up front and causing trouble.  The proper way of proceeding is to elect committees and then go to meet with officials, and I'm sure that they will come to an understanding.\"",
