	"CatDescriptText": "Freddie Jackson, 2203 Mahon Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 14, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the recreational facilities for young people in Pittsburgh are adequate? If not, what do you think should be done about it?\" answer reads: \"No, there are not enough recreational facilities.  In fact, there's only one playground and that is Soho, in neighborhood in which I live.  I think that part of the money support could come from the people in the neighborhood, but most of it should come from taxation.  And there is enough money in order to insure adequate playground facilities.  If we would only get some good political leaders or if the present ones stopped humbugging, we would be able to get playground facilities.\"",
