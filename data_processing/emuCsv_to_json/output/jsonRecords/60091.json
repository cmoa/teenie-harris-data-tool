	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. J. Nassar, Mt. Lebanon, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 16, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"So far as friendliness, I think that the missionaries have a lot to do towards creating it.  in northern section of Africa they have done well.  However, Africans have to have gumption-- they have to be self-sufficient and I imagine that they are.  I think that we lack sufficient knowledge of Africa, and for this reason we might have a tendency to look down our noses at them.  I know that when I was going to school, I, from what I received, thought they were savages.\"",
