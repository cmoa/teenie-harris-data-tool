If so, what do you think will be the cause or causes?\" Noraella Brown's answer reads: \"Looking on the situation as such, there is a lot of unrest.  But I have an optimistic viewpoint.  But there are a lot of factors when people are gaining freedom, like in Africa, which may influence the big powers into World War III.  However, I hope this won't happen.\"  Dave VanDeveer's answer reads: \"I really don't think there will be a third World War, but there will continue to be an ideological war.  Let's hope, at least, that there won't be a World War III.\"",
