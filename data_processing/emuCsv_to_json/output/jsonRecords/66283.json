When there was doubt about registration qualifications, the complaining would-be voter was sent to Common Pleas Court which quickly adjusted his complaint.  In the picture at this Fifth Ward voting place are Elizabeth Anderson, Eva Morris, 2168 Webster Avenue; Daisy Lee Hall, 2176 Webster Avenue; Dewey Foulks, Alma Pulliam 705 Somers Street and Lucille Pettigrew, 619 Kirkpatrick Street. - Harris Photo.\"",
