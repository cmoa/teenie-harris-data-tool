	"CatDescriptText": "Alfred L. King, 2109 Wylie Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 1, 1958 with question: \"Should parents compel children who are still students in high school or college to work to help support the family?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that they should. The reason is that if they are going to school or college, they probably don't have any income and therefore the family should help to support them.  Whatever income that they might have, they need it for themselves.  However, if times are really hard, the children should help out.\"",
