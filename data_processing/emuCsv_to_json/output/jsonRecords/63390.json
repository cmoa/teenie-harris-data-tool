	"CatDescriptText": "Andrew Ford, 3153 Milwaukee Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 14, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the recreational facilities for young people in Pittsburgh are adequate? If not, what do you think should be done about it?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so, and especially so, in Hill District if you judge by the density of this area.  There is more space and also more equipment needed.  For instance, take Herron Hill Park.  There is plenty of space there, but the equipment is lacking.  As for what can be done, there should be some way that money for more facilities can be provided out of the incoming taxes.  And as for the space problem, I think that some of the elementary schools should be opened in order to provide additional facilities for recreation during all seasons of the year.\"",
