	"CatDescriptText": "Cutline of image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 5, 1953, pg. 17, reads: \"Blind executive - the brains for the operation of the Pennsylvania Association for the Blind is W. Harold Bleakley, general manager, has been blind since birth.\" Larger cutline reads: \"Editor's note: As a normal worker, you sometimes complain about difficulties faced on the job.  But imagine the additional hardships you would meet as a blind person earning money for the family upkeep.  There are many blind persons who each day earn a decent wage for honest work.  They can be found at the Pennsylvania Association for the Blind, located at 208 S. Craig Street.  The Courier visited this 'lighthouse in Oakland District,' saw the highly systematized work being done by the skilled fingers and nimble brains of blink workers, and thought that you, the reader, should share the inspiration gained from a visit to the institution.  There approximately 200 persons are employed, but the services which the organisation gives benefit some 25,000 blind of Western Pennsylvania and a considerable number of visually handicapped persons.  For, besides the industrial plant setup, the Pennsylvania Institution for the Blind rendered other services.  Theme of the institution, which is headed by Harold L. Bleakley, who as been blind since birth, seems to be that with the proper education, a blind person can adjust and be occupied on the basis of his ability,  For that reason, your purchase of their high-grade products would be appreciated more than a charitable gift.  The following pictures and the companion sorty on the opposite pater, make up the first of two installments on the association, its programs, and personnel.\"",
