McIlvane, administrator at St. Richard's and Elder Nelson A. Bliss, pastor of Ethan Temple Seventh Day Adventist Church, collaborated in a nuptial ceremony uniting persons of both faiths. The bride is the former Victoria Janice Brown whose mother belongs to the Seventh Day Adventist Church; the groom is Leon Bryan Jr. of Washington, D.C., a member of the Catholic Church.  This communion of the faiths was made possibly by the recent ruling by Pope Paul. (Harris photo)\"",
