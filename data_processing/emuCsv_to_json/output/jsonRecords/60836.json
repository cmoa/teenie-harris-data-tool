	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Major Stokes, 3535 Milwaukee Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 7, 1957, pg.3 with question: \"Do you think it justifiable for residents to \"put the finger\" (notify law enforcement officers) on rackets if they exist in their respective communities?\" answer reads: \"Being a bartender, I meet people in and out of the rackets. And some of the so-called racketeers are my best friends.  So, I think that residents in any community should be hesitant to point a finger at anyone.  As a side thought, I might add that where can one get $100 for such a small gamble if he couldn't hit the numbers.\"",
