The plan is designed to defeat the practice of some real estate brokers who encourage white families to sell and move out, then the brokers re-sell the property to Negro purchasers at exorbitant prices.  The Rev. J. David Barkley, left, minister of the Brushton Methodist Church, tacks a sign on his residence at 7718 Hamilton Ave., while Earl J. Huff, right, of 7761 Baxter St., who plans to do the same thing, looks on approvingly - Teenie Harris Photo.\"",
