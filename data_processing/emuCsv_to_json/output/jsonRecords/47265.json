	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Alberta Lyles, housewife, 2116 Bedford Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 3, 1959, pg. 1 with question: \"Do you believe that relief workers, if they do not have religious scruples, should be allowed to refer relief clients, who do not have religious scruples, to maternal health centers?\" Answer reads: \"Yes, I really do.  The more children that they have, the more money which has to be paid out by the welfare department.  It seems to be a habit with some families to just wait for the check.  As a result of this attitude, some children have to suffer and sometimes the family does not even see the check.  This is a horrible thing and therefore more people should know about planned parenthood.\"",
