Penn, of 1233 Cherry Way, Braddock, who faces a murder charge in the death of the 34-year-old Lee, tried to re-enact the fatal string of events for Assistant Chief of Police Joseph pg. Devlin (seated with glasses on), and other officers last Tuesday in the basement of 1127 Washington Avenue in Braddock.  At the right, Penn attempts to estimate the distance the victim stood from him before the killing as a police officer takes the role of Lee.  Penn and Lee argued, it was alleged, over the Marciano-Moore fight and whether Penn or the victim was the better judo artist.\"",
