For years, Smoky City residents had complained of shortcomings in transportation system of cabs, with only the Yellow Cab firm having a franchise to operate. However, State officials in Harrisburg, Pa., granted the Owl Cab Company a franchise, and the new firm, headed by Silas P. Knox, formerly of St. Louis, immediately went into action. Pittsburghers, white and colored, hailed the new cabs and their natty drivers, and the first day's business was a sell-out for President Knox and his all-colored firm. The Courier cameraman followed the Owls through on the first day, and here is their panorama: Left: Nat (King) Cole becomes the first Owl passenger, as he boards a cab in the Hill District. Upper right: Pittsburgh's Mayor David L. Lawrence gives the company's cabs a first-hand inspection and passes his approval, as driver Robert Reed stands by to take the Mayor for a ride. Bottom right: Cabs and drivers line up, ready for service, as a heavy snow covers Pittsburgh streets. - Courier Photos by Moss and Harris\"",
