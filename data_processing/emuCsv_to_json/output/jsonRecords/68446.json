A1 with question \"What role, if any, do you think the United States should play in the present South African situation?  Do you think United Nations' intervention is enough?\"  Ms. Poole's answer reads: \"It's about the same as it is down South.  The United States should help to stop the African people from being pushed around.\"  Ms. Butler answer reads: \"The United States should play a decisive role...However, when you consider the situation in our own country, it's like the cat chasing his tail.  The present Administration has done nothing about th e Southern crisis and we are losing world friends because of this home situation.  I don't know about the UN resolution.\"",
