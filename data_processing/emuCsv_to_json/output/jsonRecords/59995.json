Nothing Done - A protest committee (left) which has been asking school and city officials, for 13 months, to eleminate this safety hazard to neighborhood children examines a teetering concrete slab in a razed lot directly across the street from the Miller St. School, Hill District. Standing in the rubble, which consists of swaying walls, broken brick, concrete, plaster and broken and rusted pipes, are some of the committee members, Bill Powell of Radio Station WILY; Mrs. Marie Thomas, Miller School P.T.A., and Mrs. Jane Giles, Hill District Community Council. Right, a 'cave,' in which children play, shows an exposed, rusted, broken, sharp, ragged-edged piece of pipe on which a child, at play, could accidentally impale himself. - Harris Photo.\"",
