	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Amos Bragg, postal clerk, 570 Rosedale Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 28, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\" Answer reads: \"From what I see, the general conditions concerning teenagers is terrible.  They use bad language on the streets and not in such a way that I repeat, it is terrible.  I think the reason is more or less the shortcoming of the home environment.  I think, also, that the unemployment situation has a lot to do with the lowering of morals in community.  At home the children are not receiving proper supervision, because the parents seem as though they are more interested in their own personal adjustment rather than the well-being of their children.\"",
