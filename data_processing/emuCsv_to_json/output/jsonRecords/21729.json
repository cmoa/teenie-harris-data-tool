Does he have any power? Does he exert his power?\" Ms. Allen's answer reads: \"I'm not a registered voter.  And I'll tell you the reason why.  My mother has been a registered Democrat here in Third Ward since I was a child.  Jim Luvuola is the ward chairman and he's supposed to have power to do things but he does not use it.  Before every election day, he has promised my mother a building for her quartet singing programs.  However, she has never received it after the election. And that's the reason why I don't vote.  There are a lot of promises until after election day.\"  Mrs. Bailey's answer reads: \"Jim Luvuola is the ward chairman and he does have power to get things done.  Yes, he does exert his power.  When people need jobs, he gives them jobs.  And if they're sick in the hospital, he helps out as much as he can.\"",
