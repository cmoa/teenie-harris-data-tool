McCarty, steelworker, Duquesne and Mr. Herkey Fields, Terrace Village, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 22, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe Negroes in Pittsburgh are as militant about Civil Rights like others of their race display in other Metropolitan areas in the USA? Why?\"  Mr. McCarty's answer reads: \"I don't think people are as bad for securing rights as others in other areas.  And the reason, maybe, is because the other people have clubs and organizations working for that goal, and I don't know of any such group here in Pittsburgh.\"  Mr. Fields' answer reads: \"Yes, I think they are.  We are doing more, in fact.  People are leaving here and going South and, also, we are giving money to help the cause.\"",
