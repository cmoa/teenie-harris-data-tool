Thompson Sr., and the late Mr. Thompson, was married Jan. 7, in charming rites to Charles A. Manning of Detroit. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. James Casey of Ebenezer Baptist Church at 906 Mohler Street, Homewood. Mozelle W. Thompson Jr., the bride's brother, gave her in marriage. The bridal gown was designed by Mozelle Thompson Jr. and was created by Mrs. Mary Alice Snowden. Beautiful Design - The informal white silk slipper satin dress was made shirtwaist style with a full skirt and wide belt. The chic bride also wore a white satin hat trimmed with tulle and carried a nosegay of white lilacs from Holland, with lilies-of-the-valley. Matron of honor was her sister, Mrs. Blanche Bridges, whose gown was of pink silk organza, made similar to the bride's gown. This too, was designed by her brother, Mozelle, and was made by Mrs. Bridges herself. She carried a pink carnation nosegay. Mrs. Thompson chose a beige wool crepe, with pink satin accessories. Best man was another brother, L. Thompson of the Mohler Street address, where the wedding was held. The groom is a merchandiser for the Chic Cloak Wholesale Company of Detroit.\"",
