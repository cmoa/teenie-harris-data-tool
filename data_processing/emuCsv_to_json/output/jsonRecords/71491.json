	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Ronald Mohr, college student, White Hall and Mr. Robert L. Stevens, businessman, Third Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 4, 1961, pg. 10 with question: \"Do you think that there is any need for building bomb shelters?  If so, who should build them--the individual citizens or the Federal Government?\" Mr. Ronald Mohr's answer reads: \"Yes, and they should be built, because I believe war is inevitable and in this next war all the nations involved will go all out and use all types of weapons.  These shelters should be fallout shelters, built to enable somebody to survive.  Both the government and the individual citizens should build the shelters.  The people should take care of their shelters at home, and the government should build them in cities and other well used places, like Mellon Square, Gateway Center and the like.\"  Mr. Robert L. Stevens' answer reads: \"Yes, I think there's a need for fallout shelters because the bomb is not going to destroy everything and there's going to be something left, and whatever life that is left will have to be sustained.  The way I look on it, the government should build the shelters because the people most likely to be affected by the bomb would be the working men, who will be away from home.  There is a need for fallout shelters at the homes, but the biggest need is away from home, and therefore the government should be in charge of the building of them.\"",
