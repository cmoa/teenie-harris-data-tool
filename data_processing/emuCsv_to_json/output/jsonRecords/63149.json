A1 with question: \"Do you think that the Wacs and others women's units, with the exception of nurses, should be abolished in armed services during peacetime? Why?\" answer reads: \"I can't see where it's any harm for the women to be serving in the armed forces during peace time.  It is good for the morale of those women who want to do so.  It is something for them to do other than to be around and to do only housework.\"",
