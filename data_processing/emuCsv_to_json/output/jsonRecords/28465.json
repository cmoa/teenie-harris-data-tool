McDonald Jr. - Harris photo.\" Accompanying article reads: \"Pittsburgh, Pa. - Charming and pretty spring nuptials united Miss Valerie Stewart, daughter of Mrs. Lydia Stewart, and Lieut. William E. McDonald Jr., son of Mrs. Gertrude McDonald.  The ceremony took place at the home of the groom's grandmother, Mrs. Margaret Anderson of Bryn Mawr Rd.  The Rev. James B. Cayce, minister of Ebenezer Baptist Church, performed the ceremony.  The bride was beautiful in white peau de soie, created with a flared skirt and lace jacket.  Rhinestone straps were featured on the dress.  A froth of veiling, white accessories and white roses completed the charming picture.  Bridal Attendant was Miss Effie M. Brown, who chose pink brocade with fitted bodice and flared skirt and pink accessories for her outfit.  Both the bride's gown and that of the maid of honor were created by the bride's aunt, Miss Lucille Luke.  The groom, who wore the dress 'blues' of the Army, had Ralph McNeal of Cleveland, Ohio, as best man.  A reception followed the rites at Knott Manor, where junior aides were the Misses Jeanette Wilson, Janet Wilson, Joyce Wilson and LaVern Perry.  Senior aides were Mrs. Joan Stewart and Mrs. Zeraline Crawford.  The bride was given in marriage by her brother, Harry.  The new Mrs. McDonald was secretary to the editorial department of The Pittsburgh Courier before her marriage.  Lieutenant McDonald is a graduate of South Dakota State College.  They will make their home in Utah, where the groom is presently stationed.\"",
