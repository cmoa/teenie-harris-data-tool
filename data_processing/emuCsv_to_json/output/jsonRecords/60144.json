	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Georgia Mae Humber, 708 Griffin St, Aliquippa, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 16, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"I don't know, but I think that we could do better.  However, we could do more towards better meeting the need of our people.  We need more enlightenment concerning the Africans.  There are some brilliant people there.  And I can't see how we, as Americans, especially the Negro, can look down our noses at Africans.  We cannot ignore the fact that all Africans are the darker race and many of those persons, for instance in Liberia, are well educated.\"",
