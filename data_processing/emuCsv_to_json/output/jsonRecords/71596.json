	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Rosemary Clark, window displayer, Homewood and Mrs. H.C. Moore Jr., housewife, Mt. Lebanon, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 1, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment?  If not, what type of punishment do you suggest for those who commit what is generally termed \"vicious murder.\"  Ms. Clark's answer reads: \" The world's in bad enough shape now without capital punishment.  It would be in worse shape without it.\"  Mrs. Moore's answer reads: \"It's pretty hard to say, because the circumstances alter the cases.  If somebody has schemed to kill and plotted and it is probed without a question of a doubt that it was schemed, plotted and premeditated, then the perpetrator should certainly pay the supreme price, because he has no right to kill anyone.\"",
