Pittsburgh - Charm and simplicity marked the fashionable ceremony in which Ruby Morris, petite daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. V. Morris, of Apollo, Pa., became the bride of Captain James G. Wiley, of Woods Run avenue, at the Walls music studio, last Saturday evening, August 19, with the Rev. W. Wilson of Trinity Cathedral officiating.  Given in marriage by her father, the bride wore a basque bodiced dress of white lace and finger-tip veil topped by white rosebuds which was worn by her sister-in-law, Mrs. Mary Wiley Hawkins, three summers ago.  Her large bouquet was of gardenias and marigolds.  Bridal attendants who were attired in pastels and carried bouquets of gladioli and marigold included Mrs. Mary Wiley Hawkins, of Indianapolis, matron-of-honor; Miss Carmelita Morris, sister of the bride, maid-of-honor; Miss Agnes Thomas of Washington, D.C., and Miss Pauline Mynett of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Logan Wiley was his brother's best man...  Reception aides included Mrs. Warren Tucker, Mrs. S. E. Howard, Carol Tucker, Alma Thomas, Genevieve Howard, and Mrs. Carolyn Wiley, sister of the groom, who came down from Toronto, Canada, for the ceremony...  The new Mrs. Wiley is a former student of Knoxville college, Knoxville, Tenn., and a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. She is a soror of Alpha Kappa Alpha and taught languages in a Baltimore, Md., high school.  The couple flew to Tuskegee, Ala., where they will live while Captain Wiley is stationed there...\"",
