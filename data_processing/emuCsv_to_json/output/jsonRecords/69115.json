A1 with question: \"Do you think ethnic groups (like the Negro people) profit more by voting a straight party ticket, or are there better advantages for them in splitting a ticket?\" Mr. Robert Manuez's answer reads: \"A straight party vote will help our people.  I don't believe in splitting the vote.\"  Mrs. Elva Minor's answer reads: \"I think that whoever the man is and what he stands for should be the correct way of determining who you're voting into office.  And this should be, regardless of the particular political party of the candidates.\"",
