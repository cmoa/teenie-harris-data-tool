A1 with question: \"Do you think that too much leniency is shown teenagers who commit crimes?\" answer reads: \"I believe that there is too much leniency shown towards some teenage criminals. From 13 years of age and up, a child knows what he is doing.  In my opinion, there should be a place to put teenagers, who commit crimes, like murder or attempted murder, and these institutions should not be like Morganza or Thorn Hill, but more strongly disciplined and of such a type that the young criminals cannot get out in two or three years.\"",
