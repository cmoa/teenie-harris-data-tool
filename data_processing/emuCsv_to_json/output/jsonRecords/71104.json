Chipps, practical nurse, Garfield and Miss Linda St. Clair, hospital worker, Edgewood were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 20, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you believe fares would be lower and service better on trolleys and buses if the city owned and operated these services?\"  Mr. Chipps' answer reads: \"The fares probably would be cheaper and the service better.\"   Ms. St. Clair's answer reads: \"Considering the service which I receive, to and from work, I don't think the service could be better under city operation, and city operation could reduce the fares, but not without raising taxes.\"",
