A week ago the steel striping along the curb and part of the sidewalk on the same side of the street gave a similar groan and sank.  Engineers say this portion of the Hill District still has props standing erect in empty coal-mine rooms beneath the surface, dating from the time the district was a coal mine, and was called 'Minersville.'  Severe wet spells, such as last winter and this spring brought out these props, and the ground settles, causing incidents like this. - Harris Photo.\"",
