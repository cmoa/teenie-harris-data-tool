	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Walter C. Ralney, Social case worker, 7215 Tilden Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 7, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment? If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"I think that I will have to say yes.  MOst persons who have been punished in such a way have been subjected to such a fate because of the severity of the crimes which they committed.  In rare instances have there been incorrect death sentences.  As for children under 21 years of age undergoing the death sentence, I would say that this is a touchy question.  The kind of crimes which youths have been committing, recently, seem to bring out the point that capital punishment will be a deterrent to future crimes.\"",
