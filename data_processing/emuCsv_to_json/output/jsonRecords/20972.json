	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. \"Phil\" Argento, retail produce dealer, 678 South Crest Street, Brookline, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 28, 1957, pg. 3, with question: \"What do you think of race relations here in Pittsburgh?\"  Answer reads: \"Race relations in Cleveland and Detroit are a lot better than here in Pittsburgh. But we're improving and probably will equal or pass those cities in next five years.  Perhaps the reason these cities are better off is because they have a bigger colored population which therefore plays a bigger part.  Returning to Cleveland, I might say that I was told that Negroes now are moving into Shaker Heights which is comparable to our Mt. Lebanon.\"",
