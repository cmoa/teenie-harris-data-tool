Stack, expediter, Wexford, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 9, 1961, pg. 5 with question: \"Do you think that in the final analysis, the uncommitted darker nations will join the democratic (pro-Western) or Communistic bloc?  Why?\" answer reads: \"It's pretty hard to say.  I've listened to comments, concerning the recent Belgrade Conference, and it's hard to say just what they will do.  However, I hope they will join the democratic bloc.  They are trying to be neutral, but it's pretty hard to keep from going one way or the other.  They have condemned Russia for the resumption of the nuclear tests, but they are not flocking to us.\"",
