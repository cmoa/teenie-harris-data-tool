Recently, a white North Braddock politician's family purchased the home above and began making minor repairs.  They had no trouble getting a building permit, as did Mrs. Loretta Hawkins, a Negro, and her contractor William Jackson, just before borough officials tore down the house she owned at 513 Seddon Ave. - Harris Photo.\"",
