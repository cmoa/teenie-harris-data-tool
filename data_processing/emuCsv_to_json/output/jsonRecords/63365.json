A1 with question: \"Do you favor an increase in state sales tax or a graduated income tax as a means of raising revenue for a commonwealth of Pennsylvania?\" answer reads: \"A graduated income tax is teh lesser of two evils. I don't think that t 4 per cent sales tax will bring in enough income.  I would rather have the income tax, rather than to see the budget of the public assistance program cut.  Needy persons now are not getting enough.\"",
