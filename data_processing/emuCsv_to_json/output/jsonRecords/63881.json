	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Ralph Garnett, chauffeur, Terrace Village, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 18, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"I think that they should stay open until 2 A.M., because if the people want to drink they are going to have it somehow.  There are just as many drunks at home as you find in taverns.  As for sales on Sunday, I think that the law should be changed in order to permit them.  It should be in Pennsylvania just like in some other states.  And my reason is similar to the answer to the previous question.  In my opinion there are as many drunks on Sunday as there are on other days.\"",
