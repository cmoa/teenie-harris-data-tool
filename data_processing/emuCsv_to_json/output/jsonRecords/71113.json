Hockenberry, accountant, Swissvale and Lillian Jackson, Oakland, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 10, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"Do you read daily and weekly newspapers and magazines regularly?  Do you think they present the news, etc., fairly and objectively, or do you believe that they are influenced in their presentation? If you believe the latter, who or what do you think influences the presentation?\"  Mr. Hockenberry's answer reads: \"I think the reporting is fairly objective.\"  Ms. Jackson's answer reads: \"Some of the news is slanted and some are fair stories.  I think race has something to do with the presentation.  I would say that in the majority of the cases there is fair presentation.\"",
