A1 with question: Do you believe the state and city FEPC laws are helping Negroes to get jobs they never held before?\" answer reads: \"I think state and city FEPC laws are instrumental and an aid in helping Negroes get jobs they never had before. On the other hand, as active laws, I don't think they are very influential, due to my not having actual knowledge of any persons holding such jobs secured by these laws.\"",
