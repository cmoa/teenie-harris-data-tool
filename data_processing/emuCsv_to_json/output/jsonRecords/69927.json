A1 with question: \"Whom do you think the Democratic and the Republican parties will choose for their respective presidential candidates? Why?\" Mr. Murray's answer reads: \"Public opinion seems to say that the Democratic nomination will be Kennedy.  And Nixon seems to be backed by the majority of the masses for the Republican nomination.\"  Mr. Bell's answer reads: \"Johnson appears to be the Democratic choice, because he has more prestige than the others.  And Nixon probably will be the Republican candidate.\"",
