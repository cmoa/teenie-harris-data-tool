A1 with question: \"Do you think those receiving Mother's Assistance should be required to report to the proper authorities just how all of the grant is spent, or should the present latitude in spending it be permitted to continue?\" answer reads: \"As long as she keeps the children clean and comfortable, I don't think that the mother should have to report to the state. The case workers should know whether or not the money is being used for the proper care of the children.\"",
