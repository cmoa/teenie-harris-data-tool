	"CatDescriptText": "Clarence Payne, Juvenile Court worker, Monongahela and Wilhelmina Spencer, housewife, Oakland, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, October 8, 1960, pg. 33 with question: \"In your opinion, which political party, Republican or Democratic, has the best record of keeping its campaign pledges to the people of the United States?  Which party do you think would be most successful in carrying out its 1960 campaign platform-this being a Presidential election year?\"  Mr. Payne's answer reads: \"Since 1932, the Democrats have the better record.  The Republicans, however, would better effect their 1960 campaign platform.  Their platform is conservative, while the Democratic promises tend to be more radical.  The Democratic party promised everything without revealing that results would be such things as a \"tax increase.\"  Mrs. Spencer's answer reads: \"The Democrats haven't done too bad...They could improve, as far as we're concerned.  They do better in living up to their pledges and would best keep their 1960 election platform promises.\"",
