Fortunately, there were no injuries.  However, residents of the area say that if the fall had happened earlier, there probably would have been injuries because neighborhood children play in the small alleyway adjacent to the rear wall.  The 26 dwellings in the row, owned by Lando Real Estate Co., are badly in need of repair.  In fact, the city ordered emergency work, Saturday, on five dwellings to keep the front walls from collapsing.  According to several residents of the area, the real estate company has been begged many times to make repairs to the walls and other deficiencies in the apartments. 'The last plea was four days before the wall fell,' one person said.  'But they just won't give us any consideration.'  The row of dwellings, which contains the house whose back wall crumbled, is bulging in both front and rear.  The bulging is because the walls are pulling away from the floors.  Besides the wall crumbling, the hillside behind the row also has begun to slide.\"",
