	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. G .W. Hunter, herbshop owner, Fifth Ward and Mr. Kenneth Felton, busboy, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 12, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"What do you think about Negro political leadership at local and national levels?  Does it carry 'weight' among Negroes or white people or both?  Why?\" Mr. G.W. Hunter's answer reads: \"In the first place, I don't think in terms of the word 'Negro,' because there is no such person because there is no Negro nation.  We came from Africa, so therefore we are African-Americans, or colored people.  There is leadership among African-Americans, but this is not true leadership.  We need somebody to stand up for the race, like W.L.M. Patterson and Ben Davis stood up...Our leadership doesn't carry the weight that it should among whites because our leaders are so quick to sell out.\"  Mr. Kenneth Felton's answer reads: \"I think it carries weight among both races, and especially among Negroes, because it helps us to progress and shows the whites that we can do something.  If it were not for the influence of Negro leadership, I don't think our country would be as far as it is today in recognizing Negroes.\"",
