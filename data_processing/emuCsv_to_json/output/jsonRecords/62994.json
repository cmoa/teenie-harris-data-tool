	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Harold Stoner, office employee, 1220 Hope Hollow Road, Carnegie, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 6, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that too much leniency is shown teenagers who commit crimes?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I think that there is too much leniency shown. As to how to treat teenagers who commit crimes, well I haven't given that too much thought.  But I might say that I think that parents should begin correcting as the children are starting out in life.  Also, they should be instructed in school.  I think that the court handling of children is too lenient in a lot of cases.  The children receive too many chances.  They commit crimes and then, after being arrested and confined, come out and do the same thing over or commit a more serious crime.\"",
