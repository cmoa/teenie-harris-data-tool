Do you favor tipping the barber?\" answer reads: \"That's a lot of money, but I don't think that it's too much.  And the reason is that out of eight hours of work, the barber usually only cuts about five heads of hair.  And he needs betweent [sic] 12 and 15 dollars a day in order to live.  As for tipping, well, that depends on the individual.\"",
