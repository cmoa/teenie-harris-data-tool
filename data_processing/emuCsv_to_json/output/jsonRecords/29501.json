Cephus Ford. At one time, this group was known as the Checker Club.  The Rosebud Club, 62 Arthur St., would like all to understand that to help others is the best doctrine to live by.  Semi-annually, the members of the club let the community see just what this doctrine means to them.  In July, each year, the club holds affairs for all the children and parents of the Third Ward.  The last week of December, the club's safe is opened and the contents are divided between the NAACP and the Crippled Children.  To encourage the members to fill the safe, any person joining the club is required to take an oath to contribute by buying special items.  Also, regardless of where a member is located, he must contribute two cents to the savings.  Officers of the club are President J. Cephus Ford and Secretary Bernice Warfield. - Harris Photo.\"",
