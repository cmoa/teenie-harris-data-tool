	"CatDescriptText": "Anna L. Anderson, 619 Duff Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 27, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think there is any racial tension in Pittsburgh? in neighborhood where you live?  If so, what do you think causes it?\" answer reads: \"There is racial tension in Pittsburgh to a certain extent.  We have it in the stores.  We also have it on the street cars and in other places.  I don't know why we do, but that is the way thing are.  We are the persons who receive it, although we are only the victims of circumstance.  This is true throughout the city.  Things could be better than they are.  We should all be able to live together in true brotherhood.  After all, we are all going to the same heaven, or the same hell.  Just as soon as we learn to love each other better, things will be a lot better.\"",
