A1 with question: \"Do you think students in the South are using the right technique in protesting segregation in places of public accommodations?\" Donald Noe's answer reads: \"I think that it is the wrong manner because it is causing too much disturbance.  The people who are against integration can say now that integration naturally causes disturbances, therefore they should keep segregation.  There is too much attention being given towards integration.\"  James Boddy's answer reads: \"I believe that they are going about it in the right way, because no violence is intended.\"",
