Nixon, who appears to be pleased with the interest shown by the youngsters. The meeting took place in front of the Democrats and independents for Nixon-Lodge headquarters at 2035 Centre Ave., when the Nixon motorcade stopped there Monday night, en route to Syria Mosque for a Republican rally. - Harris Photo.\"",
