Kimbo, 797 Cherokee Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 13, 1958, pg. 2 with question: �What do you think of young men or boys who process their hair? Do you think it improves their appearance or not?� answer reads: �You�ve given me the $64 question.  I don�t think that it has improved the wearers� appearances.  They would probably look better the natural way-- the way which God gave to them.  As long as they keep it combed and brushed it is all right.�",
