A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"I positively think that we are spending too much for foreign aid.  I believe that charity begins at home and then spreads abroad.  Here, in this country, we have many needy people whom we should help, and I might add that during our depression in '30s, none of the foreign countries offered to help us.\"",
