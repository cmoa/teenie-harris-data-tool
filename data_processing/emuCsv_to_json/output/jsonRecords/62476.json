Carson Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 9, 1958, pg. 3 with question: \"Do you think Negro laborers and skilled mechanics are getting a fair deal on the Lower Hill redevelopment program, or in private construction?\" William Morgan's answer reads: \"No, they are not getting a fair deal. Contractors are hiring more white than colored.  They turned me down on account of color and age.  I'm 73, but can still do a good day's work.  Travelers get jobs before local men.\"  William Beach's answer reads: \"No, they are not getting a fair deal because the Negro laboring man does not get an opportunity to serve as an apprentice.  Only white apprentices are selected.\"",
