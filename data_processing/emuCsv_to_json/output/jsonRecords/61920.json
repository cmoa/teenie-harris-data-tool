	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Jack King, 2219 Rosewell Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 3, 1958, pg. 1A with question: \"Do you think that the average family spends too much time watching television programs? If so, how has it affected family life?\" answer reads: \"In my opinion it hasn't affected family life.  We watch television together.  I think that as long as the whole family is getting along all right, it's o.k. as long as it doesn't affect family peace and unity.  It's up to the parents to supervise the programs for the children to watch.\"",
