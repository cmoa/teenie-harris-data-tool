	"CatDescriptText": "Fred Teeple, 431 Bailey Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1 with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" answer reads: \"What's wrong?  Well, it can be summed up in too words-- lackadaisical attitude.  The lackadaisical attitude is shown as the players seem to play for pay days only.  They don't have any interest.  I think that Murtaugh is using his best players.  As for not having any interest, the left fielder showed that he had no pep the other Sunday when he dropped an easy catch.  It seemed as though he didn't give a d---.  The Pirates just do not have any go.\"",
