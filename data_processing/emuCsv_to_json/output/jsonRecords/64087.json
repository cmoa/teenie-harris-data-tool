	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Marion Graves, mayor's chauffeur, 7040 Bennett Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 10, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"How do you think Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States affected relations between our country and Russia? Were you or were you not impressed by his visit to Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"I think that it did good for him to have the talks with the President.  And these talks have helped Premier Khrushchev soften up Communist China and stress the point that there should be peace through negotiation and not war.  As for being impressed, it was rather interesting to see how the people responded to Khrushchev.  At first they were just curious and anxious to see him.  Then later they seemed as though they were very happy for him to be here.\"",
