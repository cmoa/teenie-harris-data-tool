	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Richard Champion, retired, Uptown and Mr. Willie Aikens, electrician, Uptown, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 29, 1961, pg.7 with question: \"Do you believe that Russia actually 'put a man in space'--in orbit around the earth, or do you think that it was a 'trial run' to test man and rocket, prior to an attempt to put him in actual orbit in outer space?\" Richard Champion's answer reads: \"According to statements, such as the way the man landed and other words, I figure there was an error.  For the man to have traveled at the rate of 19,000 miles an hour for that distance and not burn up, has to be false.\" Mr. Willie Aikens' answer reads: \"I think it was just talk...just propaganda.  Nothing goes above the sun except God.\"",
