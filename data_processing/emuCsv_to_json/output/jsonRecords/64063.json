Williams, construction worker, 3364 Milwaukee St., were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 12, 1959, pg. A13 with question: \"Do you think that the President of the United States should intervene in the steel strike, or should he wait, and then invoke the 80-day 'cooling off' period as prescribed in the Taft-Hartley Act?\" Jake Williams' answer reads: \"I think if the President feels that he can do any good by intervening, he should. There are so many people affected by the steel strike.\"  James R. Williams' answer reads: I don't think the President should intervene.  I think workers should have the final vote in the settlement.\"",
