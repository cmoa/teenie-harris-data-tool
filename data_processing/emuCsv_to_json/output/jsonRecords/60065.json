A1 with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike?  Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" answer reads: \"There's going to be a strike, and it is my belief, that it will last about two months.  The reason that there is going to be a strike is because of the new men in steel industry who, during negotiations asserted that the industry will not pay more money for less days.\"",
