	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Deneis Crawford, refuse collector, Homewood and Mr. S.W. Gould, theatre manager, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 23, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe there is such a \"social\" classification as \"Negro society?\"  If so, on what do you believe it is based? Do you think such a basis is valid?\"  Mr. Crawford's answer reads: \"...As far as money is concerned, there's not that many Negroes with money.  There are a lot who try to be.  But I don't think there is such a think as Negro society.  Considering society as made up of persons who have the money of the Rockefellers, Mellons and others, I say that Negroes do not have a society.  They just don't have that long money.\"  Mr. Gould's answer reads: \"...Having worked in show business with people like Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Father Hines, and many others, tremendous artists in the field of music.  I've found there has been no society barrier in my association with them and with others in the motion picture industry.  There is no barrier of any kind in show business...I would think there is an educated society of people of your faith which is highly recognized.  This group includes such people as Dr. Ralph Bunche of the United Nations.\"",
