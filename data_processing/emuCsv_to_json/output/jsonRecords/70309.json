A1 with question: \"Do you think students in the South are using the right technique in protesting segregation in places of public accommodations?\" Lovelle Golden's answer reads: \"It's the basic step not only for a drive against segregation in public accommodations but also for a much bigger movement, because the majority is sticking together...It's like the bus boycott which attained desegregation.  It shows unity.\"  Don Gerstner's answer reads: \"...It is good.  And I'm glad to see that they are doing it.  They should stick together more.  They have the right to do it, to protest, and they are justified and supported by the Constitution under which we are suppose to live.\"",
