	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Charlotte Woodruff, college student, 7327 Hermitage Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 28, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\" answer reads: \"It seems to me that things are about the same.  Many communities are being kept from worsening moral conditions because of the work of service agencies, like the YWCA and the YMCA.  Organizations like these are helping better the community and especially the lives of the youngest sets.\"",
