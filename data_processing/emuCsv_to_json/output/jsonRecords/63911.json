Notice how completely the lock is put out of commission, and damage done to the door.  This was done after raiders were in the place. - Teenie Harris Photo.\"Portions of accompanying article by John L. Clark on pg. 3, read: \"On Aug. 6, a special raiding squad of police officers staged and uncomplimentary spectacle while raiding a confectionery store, owned by Prince A. Bland, at 2425 Wylie Ave.  Witnesses on the outside report hearing the crash of lumber and glass from the inside, and seeing officers help themselves to ice cream cones, orange juice, other soft drinks, and fill their pockets with 50-cent cigars...  The raiding squad consisted of Leo Flynn, Robert Hensler and Herbert James, regarded as 'Slusser's special racket squad.'  They were joined later by Superintendent of Police Slusser, Capt. Joseph Frederick, Patrolman William Ward, acting head of the squad, and uniformed men from Centre Ave. police station.  The raid appeared to be staged in a spirit of maliciousness and vandalism.\"",
