Clayden, mechanic, South Hills and Mary Sims, hospital worker, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 23, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"What do you think is the number one problem for city officials to solve in the redevelopment program?  Why?\"  Mr. Clayden's answer reads: \"The lack of adequate parking facilities is the number one problem.  An example is the fact that a person who stops just a short while to go into a restaurant, gets a parking violation tag.\"  Ms. Sim's answer reads: \"They should concentrate in the neighborhoods now, more so than downtown.  Perhaps the number one problem is the overabundance of bars and taverns.\"",
