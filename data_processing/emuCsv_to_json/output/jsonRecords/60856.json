Why?\"  Mr. Richard Cobbs' answer reads: \"No, I don't.  Speakeasies and gambling joints are not wanted in a neighborhood where there are churches.  The noises from licensed places are heard during the week, but are closed down on Sunday and things are quiet.  But the speakeasies and gambling joints have the noise going on week in, and week out.\"  Mr. James Bigelow's answer reads: \"Some taverns are bad, but speakeasies and gambling joints are worse.  They just ruin the youngsters.\"",
