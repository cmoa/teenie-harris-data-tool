Bartolotta, central manager of Mining and Quarrying, a Ros-Mac Publication, New Eagle, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 28, 1957, pg. 3, with question: \"What do you think of race relations here in Pittsburgh?\"  Answer reads: \"Honestly, I believe that there shouldn't be any barriers whatsoever.  In the small Pennsylvania town, where I grew up, colored lived there, also.  We went to school together and played on athletic teams and there was no trouble.  In mingling together, they knew just how far they could go as well as we did.  You find most of the trouble comes from the illiterates of both races.  Race relations here in Pittsburgh are good.\"",
