	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Elmer Craft, teacher, Washington and Mr. Ozzie Fortune, porter, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 14, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think political leaders, who have been granted the power of seeking or dispensing patronage should \"take care\" of their immediate family and relatives before they do such supporters like committee men and committee women and financial contributors?\"  Mrs. Craft's answer reads: \"They first should take care of the best qualified person, regardless of who he is.\"  Mr. Fortune's answer reads: \"Jobs should be given to those best qualified.  If my brother is not qualified, somebody else has to suffer.  That's what has happened here.  Too many have jobs not because of what they know, but because of who they are.\"",
