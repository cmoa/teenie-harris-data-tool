A3, reads: \"Pat Corr's Plan - This advertisement in 16th District of the Fifth Ward polling place (similar to others in the Hill District) was part of Pat Corr's bid to win nomination for Judge of Common Pleas Court Tuesday. Placing this display card beside that of the regular Democratic ticket, indicated his support of all endorsed candidates except the judges.

Roberts office, latest unofficial returns show the strategy failed, and Mr. Corr trailed the six incumbent judges. - Harris Photo.\"",
