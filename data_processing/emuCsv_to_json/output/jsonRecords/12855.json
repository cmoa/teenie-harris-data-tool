'Teenie' Harris has been taking pictures of Pittsburgh blacks for the past 34 years.  Harris' history is as colorful as the Pittsburgh Courier Newspapers history, because in a sense they are one in the same.  'Teenie' Harris and the Pittsburgh Courier are synonymous.  As the Courier photographer, 'Teenie' has taken every photo of importance snapped on the local Pittsburgh black scene in the past 30 years.  At one time a professional basketball player, and the original owner of the old Pittsburgh Crawford Baseball Team, Charles 'Teenie' Harris is as much a part of Pittsburgh history as Pa Pitt himself.  He has won many accolades for his work in photography, but by far the greatest accolade of all is the obvious love and respect he commands from black Pittsburghers from all walks of life.  Charles 'Teenie' Harris is an institution in Pittsburgh's black communities.  Sponsored by the Citizens of the Week Committee, Bill Powell, Chairman.\"",
