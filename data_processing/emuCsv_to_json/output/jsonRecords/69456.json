	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Alex Wahigren, accounting manager, Greentree and Mr. \"Ed\" Singleton, clerk, Bloomfield, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 10, 1960, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you favor governmental (state or Federal) aid to education, which would help promising students further their educations, or do you believe that the rising cost of education should be defrayed entirely by the student, his or her parents or relatives?\" Alex Wahigren's answer reads: \"In general, I'm inclined to think the student should do it on his own.  If the Government subsidizes education, then there's going to be more tax on the people.  With less tax on the people, the latter could afford to pay the college tuition.\"  Mr. \"Ed\" Singleton's answer reads: \"I favor governmental aid for persons not able to pay the cost of tuition...Without Government aid, there's no chance that such persons will get a chance.\"",
