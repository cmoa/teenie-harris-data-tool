Kudrav, social center program director, Soho and Mr. Fred Johnson, furloughed steelworker, Oakland, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 7, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Admitting many factors cause juvenile delinquency, which one do you think is the major contributor to this increasing social illness?\" Mr. Michael E. Kudrav's answer reads: \"I would say parental neglect of the children.  The parents should take more interest in what their children are doing after school hours, and also size-up the companions with whom the children are associating....The family pattern is the basic unity of society, therefore, the element of authority over the child and any breakdown of this authority resulting in juvenile delinquency, stems directly from parental supervision or lack of it...\"  Mr. Fred Johnson's answer reads: \"There are several causes.  Sometimes, the house is not supervised....  Other times, its because older people are not living the right way in the eyes of the kids...And sometimes it's because the kids have idle time on their hands and think up and do things for 'kicks'.\"",
