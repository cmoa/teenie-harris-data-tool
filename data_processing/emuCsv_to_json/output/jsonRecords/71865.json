	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Lucious Zachary, carpenter, Fifth Ward and Mr. Charles Tyler, cabinet finisher, 12th Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 16, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that political party policy makers respect the Negro vote and act accordingly, or do they take it for granted?  Why?\" Mr. Zachary's answer reads: \"They just take the Negro vote for granted, because the Negro is sold to them and they don't want jobs, but dives instead.\"  Mr. Tyler's answer reads: \"In my ward, they want the Negro vote but don't want to do much for Negroes.  It seems as though all they are interested in is the control of Negro wards.  They won't do anything about it because we seemingly are satisfied.  We don't vote enough and perhaps the reason is because there are not enough race candidates.\"",
