A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"No, Americans are not as friendly towards Africans as they should be.  We are receiving a lot of information about Africa but they are in words which the little man cannot understand.  As Negro Americans, I can't see how we can look down our noses at Africa.\"",
