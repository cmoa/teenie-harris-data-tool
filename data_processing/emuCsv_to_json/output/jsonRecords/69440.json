C1 with question \"Why do you think Negroes voted so heavily for Senator John F. Kennedy, Democrat, for President, in last Tuesday's election?\" Mr. Kearns' answer reads: \"I think they voted for Kennedy, because of his stand on equal rights and employment.\"  Mr. Fikel's answer reads: \"Because the Democrats and Kennedy are for everybody.  And, ever since the Republicans have been in office, we've had hard times.  Just what has the Eisenhower Administration done?  All he has done is gone golfing while little kids are being kept from attending school.\"",
