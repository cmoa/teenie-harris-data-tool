City of Clairton purchased these houses from the Government for emergency housing for Uncle Sam's boys. Interior of \"white\" houses is same as that of the houses for Negroes, but the exteriors present a different picture. Allegheny Housing Authority is managing both projects for the city of Clairton but insists that segregation policy stems from Clairton's Mayor Mullens and City Council. No one \"knows\" why there is no inselbric for Negro houses. - Harris Photo.\"",
