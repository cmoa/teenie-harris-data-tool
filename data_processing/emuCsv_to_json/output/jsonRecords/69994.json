	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Frank Avery, lead singer of the La Rells, Homewood and Mrs. Sara Bullock, Gimbel's employee, Cherokee Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 25, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be held responsible, to the extent of being arrested, and fined, or imprisoned, (like the responsibility for their children's attendance at school) for the delinquency practices of their respective teen-age children?\" Mr. Frank Avery's answer reads: \"No, because most teen-agers are independent and out on their own, and most parents don't actually know what their children are doing.\"  Mrs. Sara Bullock's answer reads: \"Sometimes it could be because of the parents, but at other times, I don't believe the parents are fully responsible for their children's actions.  It is not always that the parents are responsible, because the children go out with other teen-agers whose homes may not be as strict as his home.  And also, some children are more easily persuaded by other teen-agers who might call them 'chicken' or 'sissies,' and if they don't have the strength and the will to resist, they are more easily weakened and persuaded by other teen-agers.\"",
