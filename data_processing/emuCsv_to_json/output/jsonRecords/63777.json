A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in the schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\" answer reads: \"I personally feel that the counseling could be developed to a greater efficiency in city schools.  They could pattern the counseling services after the outstanding ones in other large cities.  I feel that the school system does not have adequate facilities for good counseling service.  There is a lack of personnel.\"",
