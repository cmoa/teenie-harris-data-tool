	"CatDescriptText": "Minnie Marrow, student, Schenley Heights and Audrey Woodward, statistician, Creighton, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 3, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Relative to the race riot in Montgomery, Ala., do you think the Federal Government should wait until a state asks for law enforcement help, or should the power of the United States be used immediately to protect a citizen's life when it is endangered?\" Minnie Marrow's answer reads: \"The Federal Government should step in immediately, because we all are citizens of the United States.  We all are equal, therefore, all should have a fair chance and the Government should guarantee this.\"  Audrey Woodward's answer reads: \"The Government's action should definitely be used immediately if the state government can't intervene to protect rights.  The state government should be the one to control and to protect all of its citizens.  But all of them are not doing this, as a resutl the Federal Governement should step in immediately.\"",
