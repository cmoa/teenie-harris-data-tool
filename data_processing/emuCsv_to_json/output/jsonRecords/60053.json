	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. John Boris, construction foreman, 633 Maple Lane, Sewickley, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 9, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"In one way we are, but in another way we are not.  This way concerns the large amounts of wheat, grain, and other food stuff that we have stored up in government warehouses.  I would like to see these items sent to countries throughout the world where peoples are undergoing great suffering.  I was in U.S. Navy during the days of FDR and have seen quite a lot of this suffering for want of food.  If we sent the wheat and other foodstuffs to such countries as India and China, we would be better off than sending money.  I think that what we have sent, the foreign aid, has checked communism and been a big help.  And I recall reading of a priest in South Africa who was tremendously helped by our aid.\"",
