	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. T.J. Williams, barber, North Side and Mr. C. Roseberry, parcel post porter, Oakland, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 4, 1961, pg. 10 with question: \"Do you think that there is any need for building bomb shelters?  If so, who should build them--the individual citizens or the Federal Government?\" Mr. T.J. Williams' answer reads: \"No, I don't think bomb shelters are necessary.  IN case a bomb is dropped, nothing will be left.  As for me, I'm not thinking in terms of a bomb shelter.  If a nuclear bomb is going to land, just let me be here, above ground, and go with the rest.\"  Mr. C. Roseberry's answer reads: \"Yes, there is a need for building fallout shelters.  And the government should build them.  It's natural for the government to build them because it's supposed to look out for the citizens and protect them.\"",
