	"CatDescriptText": "Zane Knauss, press agent, Shadyside and Ann Williams, maid, Heidelberg, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 16, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"What role, if any, do you think the United States should play in the present South African situation?  Do you think United Nations' intervention is enough?\"  Mr. Knauss' answer reads: \"We had better first clean-up our own backyard...I deplore apartheid, and the proponents of it can't long keep it up...There should be some policy which can be worked out rather than the one which leads to fighting...Both sides have good cases...The land belongs to the natives, while the whites are responsible for its development...About the worst thing to happen is for both sides to attempt to blow out each other's brains...I resent United Nations intervention there...Moral persuasion would be better than actual presence...Perhaps this will come about from the Commonwealth of nations when it convenes this summer...Moral pressure can do a lot.\"  Mrs. Williams' answer reads: \"We have the same trouble here, therefore I can't see what part we can possibly play over there...If the United Nations does more than talk, and acts, this will be sufficient.\"",
