	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Timothy Stevens, student, Fifth Ward and Mr. Marshall Wnuk, salesman, Squirrel Hill, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 12, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"What do you think about Negro political leadership at local and national levels?  Does it carry 'weight' among Negroes or white people or both?  Why?\" Mr. Timothy Stevens' answer reads: \"Many Negroes still think like second-class citizens when it comes to Negro leadership.  They may do what their leader tells them to do, but in the back of their minds they resent it.  If the Negro is nominated for office, in most cases the Negro will back him and vote him into office, but after he is in office, they will stop backing him to aid him to progress.  They won't respect him as much as they do a person of another race...\"  Mr. Marshall Wnuk's answer reads: \"I think it does among both races, and there should be more of it.  And the reason-well, it's just like the reason for the respect given to any other leader.  It's the recognition that if the person is a leader, he's on top only because the people put him there.\"",
