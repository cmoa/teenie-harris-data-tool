	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Emery Dukes, psychiatric nursing aide, Homewood and Mr. Paul A. Zogiman, bellman, Beechview, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you favor legislation or voluntary (appealing to the souls and conscience of men) methods, like arbitration, mediation, persuasion, etc., to obtain civil rights for minorities?\" Mr. Emery Dukes' answer reads: \"I agree with that.  For instance, I have a six-year-old son, and I don't insist that he say 'Yes, sir' or 'No, sir' or 'Yes, ma'm' or 'No, ma'm' to me or my wife.  I try to teach him to respect us and his elders.  As long as he shows this respect, that's all that is necessary.  As far as saying \"yes, sir' and so on, this is almost akin to military style.  And your child does become almost docile and subservient.\"  Mr. Paul A Zogiman's answer reads: \"No, I don't think it does.  It tends to make a gentleman or a lady out of them.  As far as being weak and having no background, the use of these words in everyday life has no effect either physically or mentally.  They are just a courtesy which children should show to their elders.\"",
