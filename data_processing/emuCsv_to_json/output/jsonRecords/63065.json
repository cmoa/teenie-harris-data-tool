A1 with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\" answer reads: �I guess that he should be treated just like any other normal visitor. In my opinion, Russia has not done anything bad to us in the last few years.  We in America go to Russia and are treated nicely, so therefore their citizens should be treated the same when they visit here.�",
