Do you believe that they should hold public office?\" Jesse Jones' answer reads: \"I don't think that ministers should be active in politics because politics is too crooked.  A minister has enough to do if he preaches the truth on Sunday and then practices what he preaches during the week.\"  Mrs. George King's answer reads: \"Yes, I think that they should be active in politics because they could have a great influence in getting people to vote for the right person.  I don't think that ministers should hold public office, however.  There are a lot of dishonest politicians, and I don't think that they should be mixed up with them.\"",
