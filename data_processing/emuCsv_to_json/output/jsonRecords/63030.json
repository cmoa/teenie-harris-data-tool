	"CatDescriptText": "Beatrice Davis, domestic, 402 Devilliers Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 31, 1959, pg. 32 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment? If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"I believe that they should be punished, but not sent to the electric chair.  Life imprisonment is a just sentence enough for a brutal crime.  And the reason I say that we should not subject a person to the death penalty is because if we do, we have taken something which we can't give.  Persons who have been convicted of such crimes should be made to reap their sins for a lifetime.\"",
