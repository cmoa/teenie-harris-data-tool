Incidentally, one of the reasons for Old Gold's phenomenal sales increase can be credited to the cooperation that the retail outlet is giving both the newspapers that are making a direct appeal to its customers and the Old Gold company.  Standing beside his Old Gold window display is William W. Goode, one of Pittsburgh's leading pharmacist and owner of this popular Wylie Avenue drugstore. - Harris Photo.\"",
