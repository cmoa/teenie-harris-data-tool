	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Martha H. Johnson, jewelry company employee, Fifth Ward and Mr. Roy Copeland, salesman, Oakland, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 14, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think political leaders, who have been granted the power of seeking or dispensing patronage should \"take care\" of their immediate family and relatives before they do such supporters like committee men and committee women and financial contributors?\" Mrs. Johnson's answer reads: \"The person out of work who needs a job should receive the consideration.  And this should be regardless of whether the person is a member of the political leader's immediate family or a supporter.\"  Mr. Copeland's answer reads: \"I don't believe in doing either.  People who deserve and earn the jobs should receive them.  It does no good to place a brother-in-law into a job if he doesn't have the I.Q. necessary for it.\"",
