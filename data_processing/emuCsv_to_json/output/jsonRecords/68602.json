A1 with question: \"In your opinion what political party has done the most for the Negroes?\" Mr. Charles Grimstad's answer reads: \"In the early stages of the New Deal, the Democrats did more for the Negroes than the Republicans.  However, since 1945, it is pretty much an even balance.  It seems to depend on which party is in the White House.\"  Miss Carol Strain's answer reads: \"I'm a Republican and it seems to me that the Republican party has done more.  They just want integration.\"",
