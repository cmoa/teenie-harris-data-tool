	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Donald Zeiler, repairman, Castle Shannon and Mr. George Smith, messenger, East Liberty, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 1, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment?  If not, what type of punishment do you suggest for those who commit what is generally termed \"vicious murder.\"  Mr. Zeiler's answer reads: \"It depends on the nature of the crime.  If it's a vicious or intentional crime, and if the perpetrator is a menace to society, I could see it.  But it's a different matter, if it's a spur-of-the-moment blow and the person didn't realize what he was doing until afterwards...\"  Mr. Smith's answer reads: \"No, I don't believe in capital punishment, because of my religion, and because of the Commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill.'  As to what should be done, well, there should be tests made on the person to see what's wrong and afterwards the person should be placed in a mental institution where help can be given.\"",
