Franklin Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 26, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"In your opinion, what constitutes the 'Leadership' in Negro community in Pittsburgh? What do you think of that which exists?\" answer reads: \"I think that the Negro leadership has a long way to go in order to be really effective.  On the North Side where I live, our leadership consists mainly of the church.  We do have other leaders here, but they do not have much power, although they are trying to better conditions.  The reason why is because of the tough opposition which comes from the predominantly white population.\"",
