McClendon and their son, Percy, 17, hospital workers from Las Vegas, Nev., could park their brand new $4,100 1953 Brentwood Trailer Home, dozens of calls were made to the Courier and Pittsburgh Hospital by folks who wanted the McClendons to rent their lots. By Monday, the McClendons were able to take their trailer out of storage and park it on a lot near East Lemington Avenue and Chadwick Street, Penn Township.  In the far left photo, Mrs. McClendon is shown in front of the trailer which boasts its own light, heat, shower and toilet facilities...-Harris Photos.\"",
