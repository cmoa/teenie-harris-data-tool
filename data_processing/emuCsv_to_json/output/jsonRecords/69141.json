A1 with question: \"Do you think ethnic groups (like the Negro people) profit more by voting a straight party ticket, or are there better advantages for them in splitting a ticket?\"  Mr. Alexander Portis' answer reads: \"The Negro should not split his vote--never!  Even if he loses out, he should not do this.  Unity is all of it....\"  Miss Marlene Wilson's answer reads: \"It's better if he votes straight, because anything that's split is not good....\"",
