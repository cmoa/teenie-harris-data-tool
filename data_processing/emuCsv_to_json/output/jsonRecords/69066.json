Gen. Robert Kennedy's request for a 'cooling-off' period in their program to test segregation laws of certain Southern states?\" Jean Kelly's answer reads: \"I don't think they would gain anything by waiting.\"  Albert I. Smith's answer reads: \"Really, I think they should continue, I don't think that the Attorney General is doing much.  Actually, I don't think that he can do too much, because he's a Democrat and Democrats, in the past, have not done too much for the people.\"",
