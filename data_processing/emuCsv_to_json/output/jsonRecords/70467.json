Conley, salesman, Zelienople, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, March 19, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you approve of teachers paddling children?\" Ms. Bricklemyer's answer reads: \"No, I don't.  During my high school days, a teacher paddled a girl student and got into a lot of trouble.  There are other things better than paddling, for instance, making a child make a toy, picture, or do some manual work.\"  Mr. Conley's answer reads: \"I guess it's a good think because the child understands.  That's if the rewards and punishments are immediate, not drawn out.\"",
