	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Edward Schwerin, tailor, 1646 Denniston Street and Mrs. Louisa Jackson, dictaphone operator, 7225 Somerset Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 12, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think there is as much opportunity for the self-made man to succeed today as there was in the past, or is this the era of the 'trained' or 'educated' man?  Or do you think it is 'who you know' not 'what you know'?\" Mr. Schwerin's answer reads: \"I don't think that a man has to go through college to be a success.  If it is not in the brain, nothing, not even college can put it there.\"  Mrs. Jackson's answer reads: \"This is the age of the college educated man.  As for the self-made man, some persons who have a lot of initiative can go ahead.  The best chances of success lie in a college education.  As to whether or not you have to know somebody, it depends on the position for which you are applying.\"",
