The shop is filled with containers of chemicals, boxes of film, books and magazines, and an enlarger.  Its manager, Henry C. Cohn, may be the man blowing his nose behind the counter.  The woman beside him rests her elbow on a Speed Graphic camera box.  It is the 3 1/4 x 4 1/2 inch Anniversary model issued by Graflex between 1940 and 1947.
