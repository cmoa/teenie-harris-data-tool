A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"As for friendliness towards Africans, I say that it depends on the section of the country.  Around here, we are friendly towards Africa, but not so in the South.  However, our friendship could definitely be improved.  I don't think that we are receiving enough information about Africa.  I also do not think that Americans look down their noses at Africans.  They have a tendency to help undeveloped countries like Africa.\"",
