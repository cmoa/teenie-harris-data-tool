A3  with question: \"Should relief payments to unemployed persons be increased?\" Mr. Lindsey's answer reads: \"Yes.  I think payment should be in keeping with the cost of living.\"  Mr. Woodberry's answer reads: \"That's a broad question.  For some people, yes, and for some no.  Under certain circumstances, it would be all right to give them more if they used the money for the prupose for which it was presented, but some ...it.  I'd go half-way on that question.\"",
