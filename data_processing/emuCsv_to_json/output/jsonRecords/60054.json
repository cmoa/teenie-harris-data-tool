A1 with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike?  Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" answer reads: \"I really don't know whether or not there will be a steel strike, because I have not been keeping up with current events.  However, I do think that a raise in pay is justified for steelworkers.\"",
