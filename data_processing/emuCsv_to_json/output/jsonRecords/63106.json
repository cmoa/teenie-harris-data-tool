A1 with question: \"Do you think Negro business places should have the right to operate in Lower Hill after that section has been beautified?\"  Answer reads: \"Certainly, the Negro should have the right just as well as any other prospective business man. There shouldn't be any restrictions because of race, color or creed as long as the businesses have the money and the facilities for the type of businesses which will be located there.  I say this because it is just in keeping with our American way of life.\"",
