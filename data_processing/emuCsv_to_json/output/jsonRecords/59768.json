	"CatDescriptText": "Article accompanying image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 12, 1957, pg. 3, reads: \"'Man in Street' Divided in Opinion - Has Jackie Really Quit Baseball? This $64,000 question is on the lips of just about everyone who ever heard of the horsehide pastime. Some believe Jackie's announcement that he is retiring to take other employment.  Other doubt the proud and fiery 'first' in major league baseball... they believe that come spring, when the lure of the diamond becomes most attractive and compelling to such a highly competitive athlete, Robinson will succumb to the call of 'Play Ball.'  These believers point out that Jackie has left the door open for his return, if he changes his mind.  So far, he has not sent a formal notice of his resignation to Ford Frick, high commissioner of baseball.  He still could play this season and 'pick up on his jobs later,' they add.  'The attended publicity would be of mutual benefit to be him and his employers.'  The aforementioned constitute the general comments and observations from the man and woman in street.  For specific comments, Courier reporters John L. Clark and George E. Barbour and Courier Photographer Charles (Teenie) Harris interviewed some of the local citizenry on the question which, at this times overshadows the Suez and Hungarian situations.  The comments are as follows.\" ... \"Walter Baguet, deputy sheriff in charge of Criminal Court: 'Perhaps his family interests make the difference, but I don't think Jackie, one of baseball's greatest competitors, has retired.  He's still a good ballplayer and would do the Giants good.'\"",
