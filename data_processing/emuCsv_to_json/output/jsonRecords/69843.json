Vernon Street and Anna Mae Mitchell, trainee at the Woodmen Fraternal Insurance Association, 1550 Oberlin Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 16, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"What do you think the main issues will be, or should be, in the coming presidential campaign?\" Mrs. Walton's answer reads: \"The major issue will be the problem of integration and civil rights.  We do have a voice and our people will vote for someone who stands up for integration and civil rights.\"  Ms. Mitchell's answer reads: \"Two of the major issues should be foreign affairs and civil rights.  All of the candidates realize the importance of more civil rights, so both parties, no matter who is nominated, will favor it.\"",
