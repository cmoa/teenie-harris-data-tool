	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Emma Green, housewife, 7225 Mt. Vernon Street and Mr. Joseph T. Kendrick, crane operator, Oakwood Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 23, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe there is such a \"social\" classification as \"Negro society?\"  If so, on what do you believe it is based? Do you think such a basis is valid?\"  Mrs. Green's answer reads: \"...Our society - Negro society - is based on our wealth, our living, money, and education.  The main thing, I think, is education, because when a person is educated he stands a little above the rest of the people.\"  Mr. Kendrick's answer reads: \"Yes, we do, at least that's the way that some persons feel who think they should be 'four-hundreds.\" It's money that makes the difference.  As to whether or not it's a valid basis, it's not good in my eyesight.  Although a person may have $10,000, I think that I'm as good as he, as long as I act right.  But if I don't act right - well, I'm trash.\"",
