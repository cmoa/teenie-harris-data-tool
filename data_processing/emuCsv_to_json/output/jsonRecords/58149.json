Among the hobbyists who personified the saying that \"a hobby is a symbol  of something made for pure joy\" ...Other entrants, not shown, were Mrs. Cornelia Young, of the Lemington Avenue Home, who although partially blind, crocheted a rug, and John Writt, 80, who fabricated a \"mobile,\" a hanging collection of suspended card board figures, and painted several pictures as his entries.  The Social Service Department of the Mount Lebanon Women's Club, Mrs. Donald O. Northrup, chairman, on Thursday, gave a reception at the Arts and Crafts Center for the exhibitors.
