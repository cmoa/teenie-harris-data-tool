	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Bob Davis, insurance company employee, 236 E. Bruceton Road, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 9, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"I feel that it is a necessary part of national defense, because foreign aid and our national security go hand in hand.  Our foreign aid does not necessarily mean military wares, but also it includes economic aid.  As for foreign aid halting, I have no idea to what extent it has.\"",
