A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: \"There is too much tax now, but I think that because this would be for an exceptionally good cause, the taxpayers should not oppose it. The reason is that a school is something we have to have, because we want our children and must have them educated.  Therefore, most taxpayers, I believe, would approve the raise because school should rate just as high as the best of homes.\"",
