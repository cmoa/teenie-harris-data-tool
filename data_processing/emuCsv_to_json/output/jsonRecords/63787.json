She was taken to Montefiore Hospital by a daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth Caddle, who lives next door at 709 Cherokee St. The daughter just happened to come over to see her mother a few minutes after she heard the loud thud and her her mother moaning in the tub.  Mrs. Bey was X-rayed at the hospital and allowed to return home, until the results of the X-rays are announced.  The building is owned by Frank W. Schornagle Real Estate Company, and Mrs. Caddle says that both she and her mother have repeatedly told the firm about repairing a leak above the tub. - Harris Photo.\"",
