Stanley Paul, foreman, Fifth Ward and Mr. William Sauers, male model, Wilkinsburg, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 10, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Who had the more dangerous assignment--Lindbergh or Glenn?\" Mr. J. Stanley Paul's answer reads: \"No doubt Glenn had the more dangerous assignment because he was up in the atmosphere, and also because of the weightlessness he suffered.  Glenn also faced the possibility of his capsule disintegrating.\"  Mr. William Sauers' answer reads: \"I think Glenn.  You can consider the wait alone.  Anybody who had to wait under such tension, as the flight was scheduled, postponed and re-scheduled, had to be courageous.  The average person would have been a nervous wreck.\"",
