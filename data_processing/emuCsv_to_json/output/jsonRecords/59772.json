	"CatDescriptText": "Article accompanying image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 12, 1957, pg. 3, reads: \"'Man in Street' Divided in Opinion - Has Jackie Really Quit Baseball? This $64,000 question is on the lips of just about everyone who ever heard of the horsehide pastime. Some believe Jackie's announcement that he is retiring to take other employment.  Other doubt the proud and fiery 'first' in major league baseball... they believe that come spring, when the lure of the diamond becomes most attractive and compelling to such a highly competitive athlete, Robinson will succumb to the call of 'Play Ball.'  These believers point out that Jackie has left the door open for his return, if he changes his mind.  So far, he has not sent a formal notice of his resignation to Ford Frick, high commissioner of baseball.  He still could play this season and 'pick up on his jobs later,' they add.  'The attended publicity would be of mutual benefit to be him and his employers.'  The aforementioned constitute the general comments and observations from the man and woman in street.  For specific comments, Courier reporters John L. Clark and George E. Barbour and Courier Photographer Charles (Teenie) Harris interviewed some of the local citizenry on the question which, at this times overshadows the Suez and Hungarian situations.  The comments are as follows.\" ... \"Ross Roberts, Criminal Court tipstaff, of Sheraden: 'I think his retirement is permanent.  My professional baseball career of 13 years permits me to draw somewhat of a parallel with Jackie.  I quit because I thought instead of getting thrown out I would get out on my own.  Robinson, one of the game's greats, and even today, probably realized that he had arrived at the age where a baseball player sees the handwriting on the wall.  I don't think money had much to do with his retirement.  He probably realized that he had just arrived at the age where he could see the handwriting on the wall, which says 'get out in the glory of the fame of baseball' which he loves so well.  In my estimation, Robinson, in the last days of his career, became one of the game's greatest and smartest players.'\" ... \"George F. Howe, Criminal Court clerk, Clairton: 'I don't think Jackie Robinson has really retired at this time.  He still owes a lot to the baseball public who has seen him play.  If his retirement is maintained, baseball has lost one of its greatest thrills.  His base-running in my opinion, compared favorable with Max Carey.'\"",
