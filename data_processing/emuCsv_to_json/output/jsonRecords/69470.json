	"CatDescriptText": "Marlene Williams, housewife, Beltzhoover and Lynn Rogers, medical representative, Carnegie were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 19, 1960, pg. C1 with question \"Why do you think Negroes voted so heavily for Senator John F. Kennedy, Democrat, for President, in last Tuesday's election?\" Mrs. Williams' answer reads: \"I think that perhaps the Negroes voted for Kennedy, because there has been so much discrimination against him because he is a Catholic.  Also, the fact that he called Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., when the minister was arrested may have had something to do with the vote.  And mayble [sic], it's just because the Negroes, like others, were simply tired of the Republican Party.\" Mr. Rogers' answer reads: \"I've heard that comment but I'm not sure it is the truth.  If this is so, it's probably, because they think Kennedy will provide them with more employment.  And also, it's because they probably think they will have a chance for more equality.\"",
