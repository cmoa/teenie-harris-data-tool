	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Michael McHale, theatre director, Oakland and Mr. John A. Slater, barber, Avalon Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 4, 1961, pg. 7 with question \"Who do you think is largely responsible for Negro topflight entertainers being denied the chance to headline the Grade A television shows--the sponsors, the advertising agencies, or the general public?\" Mr. McHale's answer reads: \"I guess that its the sponsor's mistaken interpretation of what they think the public is thinking.  They will be unable to deny Leontyne Price the right to sing.  If the Metropolitan Opera can present her on its stage, why can't we?\"  Mr. Slater's answer reads: \"I think that it lies between the sponsors and the advertising agencies.  It seems to me that there's a certain amount of fear of what the other fellow is thinking.  The agencies react to the fear of the sponsor, and the sponsors react tot eh fear of the general public, and as a result Negro topflight entertainers are denied their rights.  If they just sat down and thrashed the thing out, they would find that they are all pretty liberal.  It's only a matter of getting together...The reason I say this is because the general public accepts good entertainment regardless of who the entertainers are...\"",
