If so, what do you think will be the cause or causes?\"  Clayton Lipscomb's answer reads: \"There may be World War III, but not now.  Russia, as well as the United States, knows that each is very powerful.  Therefore, they won't take the chance of trying to force each other into unnecessary war.  What they probably will do is try a peace plan and git [sic] down and talk it out.  But if Russia moves, we will move.\"  James McCaffery's answer reads: \"There could be World War III.  And if so, the cause will be Russia or, maybe, the Chinese Communists who are cocky and aggressive.\"",
