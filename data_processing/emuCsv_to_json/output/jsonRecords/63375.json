	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Ethel Arrington of 6369 Frankstown Avenue was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 28, 1959, pg. 3, with question: \"Do you think that education standards should be the same throughout the city school system or should they be lowered in order to accommodate the slower-learning pupils, particularly those who suffer the handicaps of poor home or neighborhood environments?\" Answer reads: \"As far as the learning standards in school, there would be greater incentive if there were more clean recreational places, where the children could constructively spend their after-school hours. When the child leaved school, there is no decent place for him to go to have a good time.  I say that such agencies like the Urban League should do something about it.  And if the city stopped building so many parking places for cars, and built more places for people to live instead, perhaps there would be a big difference in the incentive for learning by the students.\"",
