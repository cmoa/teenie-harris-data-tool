	"CatDescriptText": "Elizabeth Harris, housewife, 2459 Waring Court, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\" Answer reads: \"In my opinion, some people, regardless of laws which are passed, will never treat others in a fair way.  Some of the laws are all right.  However, I see that there is a fundamental change of heart needed and this cannot be brought about by force.  In other words, you can lead a horse to a water trough, but you can't make him drink; you can force a person to get married, but some won't stay married.  You can pass civil rights laws and not secure fair treatment to other.\"",
