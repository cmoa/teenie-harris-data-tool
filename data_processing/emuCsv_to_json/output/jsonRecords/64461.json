	"CatDescriptText": "Aaron Page, Third Ward and Bida Ratcliff, beautician, Herron Avenue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 2, 1960, pg. 25 with question \"What is your opinion of the service rendered by the Pittsburgh Railways Company?  Do you think trolley fare rates should be increased?\"  Mr. Page's answer reads: \"I don't think that they give any service.  And in bad weather, when it's cold, you have to wait sometimes for two hours until a car comes.  And it passes you by.  Rates should not be increased.\"  Mrs. Ratcliff's answer reads: \"Very poor.  The schedule is not regular.  Some lines are overcrowded.  You can't get seates, in f act you can hardly stand.  As for an incresase in fares, I think it is positively ridiculous because of the bad service.\"",
