	"CatDescriptText": "Edwin Robertson, Wilkinsburg and Patricia Marlow, sophomore, washington, D.C., were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 12, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think students in the South are using the right technique in protesting segregation in places of public accommodations?\" Edwin Robertson's answer reads: \"It's all right.  In the Alabama bus boycott by this method, they got what they wanted.  They did it without 'raising Cain' and this got the people on their side.  If it's peaceable, it's the best way.\"  Patricia Marlow's answer reads: \"It's not a good method.  There should be some action other than by sitting down on the immediate problem, because each time a problem occurs, and there probably will be a lot of them, a sit-down will be necessitated.  There should be some other way which would lead to an overall change.\"",
