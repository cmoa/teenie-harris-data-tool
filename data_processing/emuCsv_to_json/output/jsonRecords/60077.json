	"CatDescriptText": "Vernon Davis, 7028 Frankstown Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 30, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"Probably the single woman would do things the way she wanted, like she runs her home because she would have no example to follow as the married woman with children does.  I think perhaps that men should not teach the elementary grades, because they might be a little too tough.  And also, women are more understanding than men.\"",
