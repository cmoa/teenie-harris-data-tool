A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"I definitely do not think that Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be.  We don't feel as if Africa is a part of the same world we live in.  We, as Americans, do not have sufficient knowledge about Africa.  Americans, generally speaking, have a tendency, to look down their noses at Africans and think that they are very primitive.\"",
