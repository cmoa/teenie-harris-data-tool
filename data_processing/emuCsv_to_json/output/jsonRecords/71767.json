	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Joseph Jenkins, practical nurse at John J. Kane Hospital, Schenley Heights, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 5, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"If you were advising a Negro high school student, who plans to enter college and is seeking help on choosing a vocation, what field would you suggest that he or she seek as a vocation?\"  Answer reads: \"The choice has to be medicine.  We simply do not have enough good doctors, on one hand, and jobs are scarce, on the other.  A young Negro student should prepare for a medical career.  I say, because it is a sound calling which guarantees a good living.  It is a wonderful thing to be able to help people and, best of all, make a contribution to the life and welfare of others.  Other fields are important, but as I see it medicine should be the first choice.\"",
