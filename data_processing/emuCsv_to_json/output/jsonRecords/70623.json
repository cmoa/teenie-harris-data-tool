A1 with question: \"Do you believe that the Pirates will lose any cash customers in 1961 because of the way the World Series tickets were...\"  Mrs. N. Thomas' answer reads: \" I don't think so because the people in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas are good baseball fans.  And the method of selling the tickets seemed fair to me.\"  Mrs. M. Thomas' answer reads: \"No, I don't think so because this is the first pennant the Pirates have won in 33 years.  I think the people are intelligent enough to know that everybody cannot get into the park.\"",
