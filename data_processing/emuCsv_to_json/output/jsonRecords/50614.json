Guests were on hand from many of the seaboard towns and the folks raised the merry Ned until the very minute hours of the A. M. The picture (lower right) gives you a smattering of an idea of the toggery that was the vogue of the evening when the 'Slams' entertained.  Photo shows Marjorie Washington dressed as a country girl about to burst out in giggles over the ludicrous outfit worn by George Gould.\"",
