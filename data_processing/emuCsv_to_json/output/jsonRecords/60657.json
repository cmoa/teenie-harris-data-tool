Elkins, 2261 Bedford Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I think that the minister should have a cost-of-living salary and rent-free living quarters. He should have a paid vacation like everybody else who is working.  I wouldn't care to comment on 'special days' for him.\"",
