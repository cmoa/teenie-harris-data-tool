	"CatDescriptText": "Edith Hinson, secretary to Alderman Fitzgerald, 7744 Tioga Street, Bethany Baptist, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 17, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Last week a Courier reader, who is an active church member, in a letter of complaint, criticized Baptist ministers because of the manner in which they conduct church affairs. As a result, a Courier reporter, conducting a 'man-in-the-street' interview, asked the following questions, after the interviewee had read the letter: Does your minister.... Stand at the door and shake hands with the members of the congregation, after services are over?  Visits the sick members of the church regularly? money?[sic]  Continually beg for money?  Preach pointless and lengthy sermons?  Permit the deacons to intone long prayers, when called upon to pray?\"  answer reads: \"In general, this criticism does not pertain to my church.  I'm fully satisfied with the religious services conducted there. Our minister comes down and shakes hands with the congregation and visits the members even though they are not sick.  He alway asks everybody, including the small children, not to leave until after services are over.\"",
