The remark evoked laughter from nurses Joan Fisanich and Carol Feighner. 'Laid out' and 'up,' the maestro managed to retain his sense of humor, despite having been knocked unconscious and suffering injuries to his head, back and knee.  'I heard harps,' he cracked.  'I thought my time was up.' Referring to the $2,000 damage to his Cadillac, right, he jokingly remarked that he had 'now been reduced to a lowly station wagon.'  The car, left, which Harper said 'plowed into mine,' is being lowered by city towing service employes [employees], William Pierce and Albert Clark.  It is owned by John Becker, according to police. - Harris Photo.\"",
