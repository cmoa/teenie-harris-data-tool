	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. William Bryant, soldier, North Side and Mr. Marvin Jones, soldier, McKeesport, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 21, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that men should marry women within their own age bracket (not over fiver years difference) or do you approve of 'May and December' marriages?\" Mr. William Bryant's answer reads: \"Considering May-December marriages, it depends on the individuals. If the girl is mature and a young man in her age group would not fulfill [sic] her desire and the obligations, then it's all right for her to marry an older person.\"  Mr. Marvin Jones' answer reads: \"When a girl marries an older man--say a man who is between 10 and 15 years older than she-- then the girl is marrying for security, and some of these types of marriages will work out.  However, in considering May-December marriages, some of the older men cannot meet the requirements of such marriage and that's when it ends.\"",
