	"CatDescriptText": "Rev. W.R. Harris, pastor, Beulah Baptist Church, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 3, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that integration in all schools in South should be effected immediately, or do you favor permitting a reasonable length of time? If so, how long a period do you consider as a \"reasonable length of time?\"  Answer reads: \"I'm in favor of token integration...Full integration will come in time...Most people, I think, are in favor of immediate integration, but i don't think they take into consideration, the emotional traumas which the children suffer...Your can't improve human relations as if they were clocks.  You have to condition the people into acceptance and this will take a reasonable amount of time.  However, it should not be extended too long.  Perhaps 18 months to two years would be a good length of time.\"",
