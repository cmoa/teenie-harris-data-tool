	"CatDescriptText": "Efforts to integrate the Highland Park swimming pool began in 1948 but met with resistance from community members and city officials.  In 1951 the new pastor of Bethesda Presbyterian Church, Dr. LeRoy Patrick, and the Pittsburgh Urban League joined the effort.  Only the threat of a law suit persuaded city officials to enforce non-discrimination at the pools in 1952.  Additional pressure was put on the city to hire black life guards.  In this photograph an interracial group of children are swimming in a Pittsburgh public pool, possibly Highland Park Pool.  In the center a life guard is teaching a boy how to swim.  The two boys on the left behind the swimmers feet are Thomas Strawder and his friend Thomas McDaniels; the lifeguard's identity is unknown.",
