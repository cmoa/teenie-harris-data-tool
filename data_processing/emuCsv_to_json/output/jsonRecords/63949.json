B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"I can think of quite a few who should have gone to the electric chair, so, therefore, I don't think that the judges, in these instances, have given us proper protection. And I think that society beenfits [sic] from electrocution because they have eliminated a maniac who should have been away years before.\"",
