	"CatDescriptText": "Ruby Mack, 5503 Second Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 25, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think children should be given 'allowances' (money)? If so, for what reason or reasons (just to have spending money or for chores done around the home, etc.)?  Do you think that it helps or hinders the development of the youngster?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  It will help them to have things they want.  Also, it probably will keep some kids from doing things which they would do if they didn't have any money.  The children should have chores to do.  This way, they earn the money and thereby learn to appreciate it.\"",
