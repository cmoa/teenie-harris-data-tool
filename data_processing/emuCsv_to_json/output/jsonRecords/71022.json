She and other Negro homeowners in North Braddock are alarmed over the razing, and charge that prejudice motivated borough officials to arbitrarily and suddenly tear down the home because Mrs. Hawkins' last set of Negro tenants caused disturbances in the quiet, residential, Seddon Ave. neighborhood.  Of 12 Negro homes in the immediate area, this is the second Negro home to be razed on the same street. - Harris Photo.\"",
