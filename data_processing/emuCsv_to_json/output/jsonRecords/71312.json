If so, what do you think will be the cause or causes?\" Mrs. Beanner Rogers' answer reads: \"I personally think there will be if the nations keep arguing between themselves.  And I think our country should withdraw the troops and stop messing in somebody else's affairs.\"  Johnny Starks' answer reads: \"I think so, because of the condition of things.  The mills are not working and there is a lot of unemployment.  It usually takes a war to straighten out things.\"",
