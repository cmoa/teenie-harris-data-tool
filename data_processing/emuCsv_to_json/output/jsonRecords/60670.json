	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Betty Nichols, 1030 Liverpool Street, North Side, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"A church congregation should pay the salary of its minister and see that he has some place to stay. However, I think that it would be going a little too far if the congregation had to pay for his vacation.  With a salary, the minister should be able to pay for it from his own salary.\"",
