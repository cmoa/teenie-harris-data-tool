	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Curtis Yandell, hospital attendant, of 7447 Race Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 9, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"I think so.  I think that we should do more for people here who need help.  I don't think that it is halting the spread of communism because this country has been giving the aid for years and still it spreads.  For instance, take China, who received our aid and then turned around and stabbed us in back.  Our aid would not help because most of the countries of the world are jealous of our wealth.\"",
