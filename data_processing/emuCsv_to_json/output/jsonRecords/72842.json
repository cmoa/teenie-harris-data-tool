Kress, broker, Allison Park and Mrs. Thelma Grier, day worker, Beltzhoover, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 21, 1962, pg. 6 with question: Do you think the Government should investigate Big Steel's hiking the price of steel?\" Mr. Robert A. Kress' answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  The higher price probably will have an effect on everything.  And therefore the dollar would not be woth 25c.  Inflation has to be stopped and should have been stopped a long time ago.  For an older person on pension this means he would be receiving practically nothing.\"  Mrs. Thelma Grier's answer reads: \"I think it should be because it needs to be investigated.  Steel prices are too high.\"",
