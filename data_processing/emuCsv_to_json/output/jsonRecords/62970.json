	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Ben Jones, 3108 Avalon Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 18, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should immediately enforce the Supreme Court's recent decision in 'Little Rock School Case' or permit the recalcitrant states to take their time in obeying?\"  Answer reads: \"In my way of looking, when the United States Government had the law passed, it meant that the United States' rights should be upheld at all cost and all times. And that's the way I feel it has to be if the Government is going to stand on the Constitution.  The important thing is the way that states settle the issue.  If they are going to allow the states to have their way, what good is the U.S. Constitution?\"",
