	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Vernon Young, clerk typist, of 557 Rosedale Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 17, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\" answer reads: �As far as I�m concerned, I say that he should be received with an open mind. I believe that the things which happened in the past shouldn�t be applied to the present and the future.  I know that he is the representative of Russia, but I think that the people should take the advice of the Government and accept him readily throughout the country.  He should be received with an open mind and equally as well as the Ambassador of America is received in Russia.�",
