A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"I don't know whether or not we as [sic] are friendly towards Africans as we should be.  However, from what I have read and from the visits of African dignitaries to this country some person have been well received here.  I do not thing that we have sufficient information about Africa.  Whether or not Americans have a tendency to look down their noses at Africans, I do not know.\"",
