Previous to that Billy and his boys pulled 3,500 to Convention hall in Camden, N. J., which was a terrific draw for that house, especially with Gene Krupa playing in nearby Philadelphia.  Bill has made several replacements in his outfit and he says he is all set and expects to make no more changes.  As the band stand today, it is one of the hardest jumping crews currently dishing out swing.  On vocals, Billy is still king of the crooners specializing in indigo hued tunes.  Jerry Valentine, ace arranger, who prepared Ella Fitzgerald's material in current Zanzibar show in New York is still pounding out those sock arrangements for Billy.  Other stars include the trumpet wizardry of Dizzy Gillespie and the warblings of Sara Vaughn [Vaughan], and fast-rising performer.  The band' line-up includes Gail Brockman, Shorty McConnell, Maron [Marion] Hazel and Gillespie trumpets; Taswell Baird, Howard Scott, Chippy Alcott and Valentine, trombones; John Jackson, Dexter Gordon, Eugene Ammons, Billy Frazier and Leo Parker, saxophones; Art Blakley [Blakey], drums; Connie Wainwright, guitar, and John Malachi, piano.  As Billy embarks on his second big tour it looks like the gates are wide open for him to ride into the hall of fame with one of the most promising young crews to come up in a long time.  Watch Billy Eckstine.\"",
