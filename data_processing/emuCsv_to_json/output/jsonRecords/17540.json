Vann - Spaulding Lauds Vann - Portland, Me - \"Nowhere on earth could such an occasion as we are witnessing here today occur but in our own America,\" asserted C.C. Spaulding, president of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance company in Durham, largest all-Negro business in world, as he delivered the principal speech Sunday at the launching here of the Liberty ship, \"S.S. Robert L. Vann\" in memory of the late lawyer, politician, humanitarian, and publisher under whose leadership The Pittsburgh Courier became the biggest and most influential Negro newspaper, extant. \"The launching of the Robert L. Vann - sixth Liberty ship to be named for an outstanding Negro - marks another epoch in the annals of American history.\" Mr. Spaulding said.  Robert L. Vann was a leader, a statesman, an organizer a publisher of note, and my personal friend,\" the insurance magnate continued.  \"I repeat that he was such an organizer that The Courier, which he edited and controlled for 30 years, has been so successfully managed since his passing that the circulation has been increased from 170,000 to 255,000 under the leadership of his comrade and successor, Ira F. Lewis, and his devoted companion, Mrs. Robert L. Vann, who stood so nobly by the late humanitarian during his brilliant career.  \"Both his ideas and ideals will be carried forward by this, the S.S. Robert L. Vann, as it plows the sea, as well as by his successors in the great Courier family.  The naming of the six ships for outstanding Negroes has done more to inspire and encourage Negro Americans than any other act of the National Maritime commission.  My congratulations and God bless you all.\"  From all walks of life came prominent figures to attend the testimonial luncheon at the Lafayette Hotel and the christening ceremony for the Liberty ship \"S.S. Robert L. Vann,\" Sunday in the New England shipbuilding yards in South Portland, Maine...\"",
