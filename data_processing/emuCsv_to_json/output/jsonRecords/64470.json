A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower is as popular today as he was when he first was when he first took office?  Why?  Do you think that the fact that he is not running for office will influence the election?\" Mrs. Ethel Gray's answer reads: \"He is less popular and because of the state of everything.  He has done nothing... I don't think that he will or should attempt to influence the outcome of the elections.\"  Mr. Kurt Hollstein's answer reads: \"I don't think he is as popular as he was.  The reason, well, I think that because this is his last term he is letting up a little.  I wouldn't know about the influence on the election, but I think that Eisenhower's not running will have some effect.\"",
