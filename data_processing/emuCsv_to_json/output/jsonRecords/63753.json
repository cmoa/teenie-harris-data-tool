	"CatDescriptText": "Effie Smith, 528 Grace Street, Mt. Washington, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"There are not enough stories which attempt to influence public opinion...Today's news is what the publisher wants, like murders and crimes for page one.  My opinion, is that the newspaper, should emphasize why a person commits the crime which is reported.  Newspapers are freer today.  If there is any influence, it is very little.\"",
