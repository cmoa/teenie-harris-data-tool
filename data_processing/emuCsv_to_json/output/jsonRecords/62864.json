Worried sick after more than two months of futile house-hunting, the widower had to undergo hospital treatment shortly after a Redevelopment official virtually forced him to move into the street with his family of five school-age children.  \"I don't know what I would have done if it hadn't been for an older daughter who took the kids in,\" Banks, whose right hand is paralyzed, said.  His furniture is shown stored in an abandoned building in redevelopment area. - Harris Photos.\"",
