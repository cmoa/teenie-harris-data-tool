	"CatDescriptText": "Earl Hord, 806 Anaheim Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 1, 1958 with question: \"Should parents compel children who are still students in high school or college to work to help support the family?\" answer reads: \"In answering the question, I might say that there is a difference between students in high school and those in college. In regards to the high school student, he should be required to help to support the family if there is a need of that.  In college, it is necessary for the child to work, because it helps to show him the value of the dollar.\"",
