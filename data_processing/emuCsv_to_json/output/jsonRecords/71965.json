Soffel, retired, South Hills and Mr. Charles Cutrary, truck driver, Homewood , were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 30, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the Christian Church is doing an effective job in improving racial amity in the city, nation and throughout the world?\"  Mr. Soffel's answer reads: \"I think it is.  I think that if this question has been asked about eight or nine years ago, the answer would have been no.  At the present time, the churches are doing fair.  There's a much better job to be done and the church is more aware of the need for the job to be done.\" Mr. Cutrary's answer reads: \"The churches are doing a fair job.  However, there could be a lot of improvement.\"",
