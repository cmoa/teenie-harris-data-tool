	"CatDescriptText": "Obie Griffin, policeman, 7334 Hermitage Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 15, 1959, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"If the crime warrants this man to be sent to the electric chair, I think that he should get the supreme penalty. Nobody wants to die, therefore, for any person to deliberately take a life, he should be made to pay the supreme penalty.  For instance, the other day, in 'Battle of Chicken Hill,' the battle was with a thug called Galto who had shot at a policeman on a previous occasion.\"",
