A1 with question: \"Do you think that cab drivers in general take advantage of other motorists and pedestrians in traffic? As a group, would you call them courteous or discourteous?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  Some people are prone to take isolated incidents and blow them up to the extent of saying that all cab drivers are wreckless [sic].  The majority of them perhaps are better than the average person who drives a few miles or a couple of blocks.\"",
