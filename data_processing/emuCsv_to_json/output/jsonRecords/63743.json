	"CatDescriptText": "Frank Madonna, salesman, Pittsburgh, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\" Answer reads: \"Newspapers always have influenced, greatly, public opinion.  ONe example today, concerns segregation in which newspapers have helped correct conditions.  Another example concerns the articles on the Mafia, which has formed bad public opinion because of the reflection on decent Italian citizens.  In a way, the articles cast a shadow on all U.S. citizens who are Italians...Newspapers are not as free in other fields, politics has a lot to do with them.\"",
