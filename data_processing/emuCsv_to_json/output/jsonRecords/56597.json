Another teen-age dance was held by the Boys Department of the Centre Avenue YMCA the same night.  The young folks in the top right photo are shown as they danced to the music of Doc Miller's band at the Centre Avenue YMCA.  The Enchanters, local vocal group were also on the program.  Of course, in all neighborhoods there were the youngsters who went from house-to-house \"playing trick or treat.\"  There was plenty of goodies on hand at home to supply them with treats, and merchants and even police in the case of the picture shown at the bottom, left, ..many neighborhoods had handouts for the bemasked kiddies.  Patrolman Robert Harris and Clinton Sadler at Centre Avenue police station are shown handing out the goodies which were supplied by all of the policemen, white and colored.  Affairs such as the one shown at Wadsworth Hall in the middle, right photo, sponsored by the staff of the Soho Community House, were held in all community centers and at Vann, Weil and Letsche Schools.  Hill City held its annual Halloween parade through the Hill District, led by the Hill City band, as shown in the bottom right picture. - All Photos by Sockwell, except picture of police by Harris.\"",
