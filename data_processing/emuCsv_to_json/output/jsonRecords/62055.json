A1, with question: \"Do you approve of women bartenders?\" Mr. James Embry's answer reads: \"No, and one reason is there is too much notoriety, too many risks, and too filthy a job for women, in fact, the way I look at it, if a woman has to go into a bar just as a customer, let her take a table and booth and be seated and served.\" Mr. Jack Mager's answer reads: \"Absolutely not, and mainly because a guy who goes to the bar likes to talk men's talk. With women around, you can't talk as you would like to without offending the women.\"",
