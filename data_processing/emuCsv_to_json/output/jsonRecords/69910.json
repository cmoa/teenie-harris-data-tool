	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Coy Allen, baseball scout, Schenley Heights and Mrs. Alice Jones, bakery shop worker, Glen-Hazel, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you favor legislation or voluntary (appealing to the souls and conscience of men) methods, like arbitration, mediation, persuasion, etc., to obtain civil rights for minorities?\" Mr. Coy Allen's answer reads: \"For one, I was raised to say 'Yes, sir,' and 'No, sir,' and this made me stand up for my convictions.  But today, kids believe it's old-fashioned to say 'Yes, sir,' and 'No, sir,' and 'Yes, ma'm,' and 'No, ma'm.'  And by doing this, if the elders are not their parents, the lack of the use of these words seemingly put the kids on the same equal level as the grown-ups.  I'm inclined to believe that the use of 'Yes, sir' and No, sir' and so on, is just respect due to parents and elders.\"  Mrs. Alice Jones' answer reads: \"No, I don't.  I have two and I have always taught them to say 'Yes, sir' and 'Yes, ma'm', to their elders.  It should be natural like other manners.\"",
