In some places, they are improving, and in others, they are not.  For instance, at work, I get along fine with everybody except one person.  In Presto, where I live, the majority of families are white and we, all of us, get along fine.\"  Mrs. Mary Stephens' answer reads: I don't see where they are getting any better.\"",
