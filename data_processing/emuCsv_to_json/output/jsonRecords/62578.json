A1 with question: \"Do you think that Sherman Adams was guilty of misconduct in office of assistant to the President? Do you think that he should have resigned?\" answer reads: \"I wouldn't say that he was guilty of misconduct in office, but I don't think that he used good judgement in the position of importance which he held.  As to whether or not he should have resigned, I say absolutely, he should have.  He did more harm waiting until he was forced to resign rather than resigning right away.  He did harm to himself and to the party.\"",
