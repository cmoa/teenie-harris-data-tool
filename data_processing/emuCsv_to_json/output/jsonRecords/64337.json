Butler, candy store employee, 3 Arbor Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 5, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should press in the fight for civil rights, or should they seek them through such medium as conciliation, persuasion and patience?\" Lawrence Hungerford's answer reads: \"They should press, however when it comes to marriage, they should marry their own, the same as whites should do.\"  Herman F. Butler's answer reads: \"Through patience, because, in my opinion, you gain more in the long run.  Although it is a slow process, it seems better because in using pressure you may overlook a lot of things which would not have been done if patience had been used.  Through pressure, you learn too late that some things were overlooked.\"",
