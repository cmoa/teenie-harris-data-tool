Moore will head the Hill District station (No. 2), the New Courier learned this week. He is expected to assume command of the Centre Ave. Police Station Monday.  Insp. Moore, now assigned to the Mt. Oliver station, earned the respect of the black community during his tenure as director of the police department's Community Relations Division.  His transfer to Mt. Oliver was Criticized by black activists who were clamoring for Moore's transfer to East Liberty (No. 5) of the Hill District.  Former Public Safety Director David W. Craig resisted the transfer of Insp. Moore to the black community despite the demands of the black community. Also, reportedly turning down Moore's transfer were Police Superintendent James Slusser and his assistant, John Kelly.  Insp. Moore's long-awaited transfer was made by newly appointed Public Safety Director James Cortese.  It was not learned if Slusser or Kelly supported the move.\"",
