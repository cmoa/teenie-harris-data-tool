Left to right: Helen Dowdy, the original 'Strawberry Woman'; Dolores Ivory, Cab Calloway, the marvelous 'Sportin' Life'; Martha Flowers, the beautiful 'Bess'; Catherine Eason, the poignant 'Clara,' and an alternate 'Bess,' and Gordon Watkins, who plays Clara's husband, 'Jake.' Not pictured are LeVern Hutcherson, who has the title role of 'Porgy'; John McCurry, the realistic 'Crown,' and one of the show's great performers, Carol Brice, who almost steals the show with her 'Maria.' Beautiful sets and the many beautiful songs make the folk opera a MUST for theatre-goers. - Harris Photo.\"",
