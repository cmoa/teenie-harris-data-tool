	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. William S. Anderson, 69918 Chaucer Street, Homewood, and Miss Billie Grant, 3102 Iowa Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" Mr. William S. Anderson's answer reads: \"I think that the church congregation should give the minister everything except the 'special gratuity.' The reason the congregation should do these things for the minister is because of his service.\"  Miss Billie Grant's answer reads: \"Yes, I think that the congregation should pay the minister a cost-of-living salary, give him rent-free living quarters, pay for his vacation and also hold special gratuity days for him.  By giving him these things, the minister will have more time to serve the community.  Take the case of Rev. Ramsey Bridges, my minister, for instance.  His services to the church and to the community leave him little time for anything else.  He would have a hard time performing these services and working to obtain extra money.\"",
