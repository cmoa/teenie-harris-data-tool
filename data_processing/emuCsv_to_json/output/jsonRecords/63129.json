	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Harry Huff, demolition man and father, of 131 Erin Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 21, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: \"From my opinion, as a demollition worker who has helped to tear down many schools, I would say there are too many old schools, which are fire hazards, therefore, I think that more money is needed to correct this situation. However, I think that most of the people will oppose a raise in taxes to benefit the schools, and the reason probably would be because they think that they have too many taxes already.\"",
