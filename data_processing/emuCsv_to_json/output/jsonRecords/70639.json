A1 with question: \"Do you believe that the Pirates will lose any cash customers in 1961 because of the way the World Series tickets were...\"  Mr. Bennett's answer reads: \"I don't think that the loss of any cash customers will result.  The people who missed out on the tickets probably are good sports and realize that everyone couldn't receive tickets.\"  Mr. Burton's answer reads: \"I don't think so.  I don't think it matters much to them.  And knowing Pittsburgh sports fans to be a crazy type of people, about sports, I think that they will support them regardless of what happened or happens.\"",
