Kennedy, Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States. After inviting his GOP rival, Vice President Richard M. Nixon to \"come to Pittsburgh and tell the unemployed and the part-time steel workers that they never had it so good,\" Senator Kennedy charged Mr. Nixon with being a \"risktaker abroad\" but a conservative at home.
