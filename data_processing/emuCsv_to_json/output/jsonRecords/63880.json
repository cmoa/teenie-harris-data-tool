A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"No, is my answer to both questions, because to do so would be wrong.  Sunday is a religious day and it should be kept that way.\"",
