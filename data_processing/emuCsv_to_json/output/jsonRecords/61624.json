The baby is carried each trip from Beaver Falls to the jail in Beaver by his great grandmother, Mrs. Gertrude Snowden.  The sentence, viewed as one of the stiffest numbers terms meted out in Beaver County's history, came after Judge Robert E. McCreary and District Attorney Richard S. Stewart did not believe that the baby's mother was telling the truth when she failed to give the complete identification of a racketeer. - Harris Photo.\"",
