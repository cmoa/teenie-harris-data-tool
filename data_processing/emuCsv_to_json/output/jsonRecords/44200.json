Here they are with their son Raymond, in a jubilant mood, right outside the courtroom where Johnson was given his freedom last Friday, ending for him the fear of \"Alabama justice.\"  His case attracted nationwide attention.  The NAACP took up the fight, with some of the best attorneys in country pitting their ingenuity and ability against the forces of Alabama which sought to extradite him for a \"crime\" he didn't do.   His life over a period of years has been one of constant fear that he might have to return to Alabama. - Harris Photo.\"",
