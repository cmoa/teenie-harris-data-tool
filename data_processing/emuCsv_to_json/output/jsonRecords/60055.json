	"CatDescriptText": "John W. Colbert, galvanizer, 6961 Lemington Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 23, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike? Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" Answer reads: \"No, I don't believe that there will be a strike.  And the reason is that the strike would be one of the worst that we have had in history.  I think that the wages should be frozen for the simple reason that if they got a raise in pay, it wouldn't do them any good.  If the steelworkers could receive enough of a raise, it would be all right.  But, usually, they only receive just a little increase in pay.\"",
