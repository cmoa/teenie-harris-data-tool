	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Carl Frohne, student, Glassport and Mrs. Anita Gibson, housewife, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 10, 1960, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you favor governmental (state or Federal) aid to education, which would help promising students further their educations, or do you believe that the rising cost of education should be defrayed entirely by the student, his or her parents or relatives?\" Carl Frohne's answer reads: \"I'm a U.S. Defense Loan student myself at the University of Pittsburgh.  And if it were not for that fact, I would not be going to college.  You asked about my high school standing, well, I graduated with second highest honors.\"  Mrs. Anita Gibson's answer reads: \"The way the country is being run now, we tend to depend too much on governmental aid.  Perhaps we would not need Government aid if there were enough jobs.  However, as things now stand, I'm in favor of governmental aid.  There are a lot of Negroes who could not make it to school if they did not receive governmental aid.\"",
