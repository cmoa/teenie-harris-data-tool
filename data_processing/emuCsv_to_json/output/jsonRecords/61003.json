A2, reads: \"Crippled Children, NAACP Helped by Checker Club - Pennies from 'Deep Wylie' - Beginning in 1956, the Checker Club, with headquarters at 1410 Wylie Ave., holds an annual opening of its safe, which contains pennies club members drop into a slot in top of the big strong box throughout the year. The safe is cemented to the floor, so as to prevent unauthorized changes in location, and remain locked until Dec. 12, when it is broken open, its contents weighed and equal shares are donated to the NAACP and Crippled Children's Fund.  Last year, each organization was the recipient of $632.43.  This year's yield of pennies totaled 196 pounds, with a local bank sill counting the coins at press time.  J. Cephus Ford, president, and some of the club members are weighing the coins in the club's headquarters.  Among the club members are: 'Brother' Howell, 'Chinny' Moore, Oliver Gray, John Henry, 'Joe' Smith, 'Hot Rod,' 'Braddock Red,' 'Pretty Eddie' (or Birmingham); 'Geech,' 'Red,' 'Arkansas Fats,' 'Slim,' Owens, A. Brown, 'Blue,' 'Tilly,' 'Can't Spare It,' Marvin and 'North Side Will.' - Harris Photo.\"",
