They have the \"Y\" for swimming and there is also a center in Sweickley which holds dances for youth of the Coraopolis area and surround communities.  The youth program is complete from kindergarten up to teen-agers.\"  Miss Anna Lee's answer reads: \"We don't have any community recreational facilities and the people in my town are not doing anything about the situation.\"",
