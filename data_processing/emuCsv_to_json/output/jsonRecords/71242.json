A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes, when unable to obtain a 'square deal,' in politics, should register a 'protest' vote by voting for Negro candidates on a ticket, or should they utilize other tactics to protest and continue to vote for all candidates who are qualified and will serve their interests best?\" Joseph McBurney's answer reads: \"I think they should vote Republican and that would solve the problems.\"  Catherine Thomaszewski's answer reads: \"They should take other action if the candidate or candidates they nominate and elect won't help them.\"",
