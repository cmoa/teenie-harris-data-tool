Does he have any power? Does he exert his power?\" Answer reads: \"I'm not too much interested in politics and therefore don't know the ward chairman nor whether he has power.  however, if his power is measured by the ability to get things done, I'll say that he seemingly does not have much power because there are a lot of things that should be done.  One is the replacement of outdoor lights at apartment entrances which were removed several years ago.  Here in Bedford Dwellings, you're almost too scared to come home at night in darkness.\"",
