	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Edward McDonald, church janitor, Homewood and Rev. Joseph McMahon, minister, Verona, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 25, 1961, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you think Federal aid to schools should be granted to parochial as well as public schools?\" Mr. McDonald's answer reads: \"Yes, and then all the youngsters would be able to get educated.  I don't see why some get school aid and others don't.\" Rev. McMahon's answer reads: \"No, I don't, because I believe it is unconstitutional, and I believe that it would defeat the principle of the separation of church and state and bring other complications.  Also, because we have a Catholic President, I think it would injure him in some ways.  It's better that they don't give aid to parochial schools, because the Catholics will receive the greatest benefit.\"",
