Wilder, porter, Robinson Court, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 27, 1962, pg. 12 with question: \"What is the most important issue confronting Pittsburgh in 1962?\" Mr. Mattola's answer reads: \"Taxes; Governor Lawrence says there won't be a rise in taxes, and if he says so, there usually is not.  But still it's the big issue...\"  Mr. Wilder's answer reads: \"Taxes is one of the biggest problems, because we have too much of them.  If we had enough money after the taxes we would be all right.  We can't all be right.  We can't make ends meet on account of we ware not making enough money and because the taxes take so much pay.\"",
