	"CatDescriptText": "Pritt Galford, computer operator, Pittsburgh, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\"  Answer reads: \"I think that we must agree with President Eisenhower's words that a change of opinion is necessary... In some matters, like the voting right, I think that a law is necessary.  However, I do not agree with the 1954 Supreme Court ruling concerning the integration of the schools.  A change of heart is needed for this situation.  I believe in the doctrine of 'separate but equal' in regards to education.  Negroes should go to Negro schools and whites to white schools.\"",
