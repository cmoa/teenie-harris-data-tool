A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I think so.  Why not?  If people want this and some of them do, why not give it to them?  As for the sales of beer and wines on Sunday, I think that should be left up to a vote of the people.\"",
