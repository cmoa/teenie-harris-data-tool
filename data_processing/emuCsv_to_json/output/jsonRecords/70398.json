A1 with question: \"Do you approve of teachers paddling children?\"  Ms. Horsmone's answer reads: \"Yes, I do, as long as it isn't me.  If the child gets out of hand, then paddling should be used.\"  Ms. Hillman's answer reads: \"HIgh school kids should not be beaten.  At that age, the teacher should be able to explain to the student just what the correct action should be.  For the children in grades one to five, paddling should be alright.  But in junior and senior high schools, there should be no paddling.\"",
