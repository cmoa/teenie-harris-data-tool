Clark on pg. 3, read: \"On Aug. 6, a special raiding squad of police officers staged and uncomplimentary spectacle while raiding a confectionery store, owned by Prince A. Bland, at 2425 Wylie Ave.  Witnesses on the outside report hearing the crash of lumber and glass from the inside, and seeing officers help themselves to ice cream cones, orange juice, other soft drinks, and fill their pockets with 50-cent cigars...  The raiding squad consisted of Leo Flynn, Robert Hensler and Herbert James, regarded as 'Slusser's special racket squad.'  They were joined later by Superintendent of Police Slusser, Capt. Joseph Frederick, Patrolman William Ward, acting head of the squad, and uniformed men from Centre Ave. police station.  The raid appeared to be staged in a spirit of maliciousness and vandalism.\"Cutline of image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 16, 1960, pg. 3, reads: \"'Director Rosenberg Concerned Only With Special Racket Squad - 'Beat Cops' and Disposition of Cases Not Included in Report of James Squad - Without a Search Warrant - Director of Public Safety Louis Rosenberg has been eloquent and steadfast in defending the racket squad when it was under the command of Detective John James.  At no time, however, has he touched upon failure of the squad to justify raids by displaying search warrants, or damage to property after raiders had gained entrance to the premises.  Above are five views of damage inflicted by the James squad raiders on August 6, 1958, after they entered through an unlocked front door at 2425 Wylie Ave...  No. 2: After being admitted to this rear room on the first floor, raiders broke lock and panel from inside of room....   This damage also was perpetrated after raiders were inside the building.  The owner of the confectionary store at 2425 Wylie Ave., Prince Bland, was not present when the raid was started, by clerks and other witnesses, including customers, stated that a search warrant was not displayed - or mentioned.  In addition to cutting the telephone wires in the establishment, the raiders smashed a total of 12 locks, a full-length mirror, destroyed merchandise and cracked plaster in almost every room in the store and apartment.  Most of the damage was done after the officer obtained $600 in cash, some numbers slips and an adding machine, witnesses said. - Harris Photo.\"",
