A1 with question: \"Do you think that the Wacs and others women's units, with the exception of nurses, should be abolished in armed services during peacetime? Why?\" answer reads: \"I can see no reason to abolish them, that is, if they serve a purpose, and I think that they do.  Their service, which was used during war time, can well be used during peace and thus allow men to engage in other jobs.\"",
