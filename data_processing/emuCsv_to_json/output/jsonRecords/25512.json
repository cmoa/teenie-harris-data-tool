The task which confronts us of the most significance is the Oakland Raider team.  I can't help believing that they will come up with the lucky play.  Did you watch the Oakland-Miami game?  Well you know what I mean then.  I'm not that much of a football fan, but I feel that the Steelers will have to work closely together to beat them.\"",
