	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. J.E. Addison, housewife, Sewickley and Ruby Brown, student, Homewood, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 2, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that single persons and \"socially undesirables,\" displaced by urban redevelopment programs, should be compelled to find new homes for themselves, or should some other agent be held responsible?\"  Mrs. Addison's answer reads: \"They should have the privilege and right to live where their money can buy, and then it's up to the community to get them out if they are undesirable...We have organizations to help persons who need help in finding housing and these agencies should step in when they are needed.\"  Ms. Brown's answer reads: \"Personally, I feel it's a fifty-fifty thinking, because if a person is really interested, he will help himself.  However, it shouldn't be left entirely up to the displaced person, because, after all, it wasn't his fault that he had to move.\"",
