A1 with question: \"Do you think that high school students should strike in order to air grievances or to gain their objectives?\" Aaron Grimsley's answer reads: \"I don't think so. I don't think that it benefits them.  The more schooling that they get, the better.  If they go out on strike the only losers are they.\"  William Tucker's answer reads: \"I don't think that they should, because I don't see how it benefits them.  While they are on strike they are not learning anything.  I honestly don't think that the school system carries out a program that is so radical as to make the children go out on strike.\"",
