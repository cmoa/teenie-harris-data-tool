Although some testimony was taken trial was continued until September.  Top left picture shows a group leaving court room at end of day's session.  Picture at right included Mrs. Howell, mother of one of the defendants, (in foreground wearing glasses) and the Rev. E. C. Jackson (facing camera in background).  The Rev. Mr. Jackson was slated to appear as a character witness.  Bottom left photo shows Gilbert Womack, jitney driver, leaving court room behind his attorney, George Little.  Womack is out on bond.  Bottom right photo shows Sara Louise Gordon unknowingly standing behind Gilbert Helwig (wearing glasses) who is counsel for Clifford Lloyd and Charles Young accused of molesting her.  Miss Gordon was released from jail last week on $250 bond after her plight was brought to the attention of Judge Samuel Weiss.  Police were afraid that Miss Gordon might disappear before trial.  Shortly after these pictures were made, Courier cameraman 'Teenie' Harris was threatened by mother of one of the defendants.  Threat was made in presence of Lieut. Sylvester Stoehr of the East Liberty Precinct.  Another Courier cameraman was threatened in the Court House two months ago, causing District Attorney William S. Rahauser to state: 'No one is going to come in here and interfere with newspaper, men and women who are going about their legitimate business.' - Harris Photo.\"",
