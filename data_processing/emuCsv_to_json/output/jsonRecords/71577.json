	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Leonard Rusnak, student, Beechview and Mr. Carl Redwood, social worker, East Liberty, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 25, 1961, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you think Federal aid to schools should be granted to parochial as well as public schools?\" Mr. Rusnak's answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  It should go only to public schools.  I believe that the Catholics can go to public schools, but if they want the special advantages of instruction in their own religion that the Catholic religion can give, they should pay for it.\"  Mr. Redwood's answer reads: \"I do.  I think that the aid should go to parochial, but not to private schools.  The reason parochial schools should be aided is because they have the same school setup as the public.  In fact, it's unfair to give to public and not to parochial schools.\"",
