Well, that's just what one well-known Pittsburgher has going for him.  Genius at Work - (Upper left) The talented Clifford Morrison, of 850 Delmont Avenue, Beltzhoover, who is possessed with a great amount of creative ability, is shown at the back-geared, screw-cutting automatic lathe 'truing an absolute round for a bearing race.' The metal of the bronze bearing race, which hold the bearing cup, is so sensitive to temperature changes, that it has to be cooled, after holding it in one's hands for a few moments, before it will fit perfectly.  The limit of tolerance of the metal is one one-thousandth of a inch.  Some limit, eh?... - Harris Photos.\"",
