Mazza, hotel assistant engineer, 521 Fairywood Street and Mrs. Rebecca Cornelius, domestic, 125 W. 12th Avenue, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper December 19, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower is as popular today as he was when he first was when he first took office?  Why?  Do you think that the fact that he is not running for office will influence the election?\" Mr. J. Mazza's answer reads: \"No, I don't think that is is as popular today.  At the beginning of his term, his popularity was because of the promise to bring back the soldier boys.  Today, he has lost some of the popularity... I don't think that his not running for the presidency will have any influence on the outcome.\"  Mrs. Rebecca Cornelius' answer reads: \"I imagine he is as popular today... The people think that he is trying to do something.  His goodwill tour also is helping his popularity.  I can't say about the outcome of the election.\"",
