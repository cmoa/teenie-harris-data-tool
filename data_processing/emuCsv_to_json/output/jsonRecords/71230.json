Jones, housewife, Homewood and Louise Robinson, housewife, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 22, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes, when unable to obtain a 'square deal,' in politics, should register a 'protest' vote by voting for Negro candidates on a ticket, or should they utilize other tactics to protest and continue to vote for all candidates who are qualified and will serve their interests best?\" Maude Y. Jones' answer reads: \"We should judge candidates by the qualifications...But by living in the 13th Ward, my sympathy is with the colored candidates.  I don't think they are receiving a square deal under the present political set-up in the city...\"  Louise Robinson's answer reads: \"I believe all colored neighborhoods should run their own areas so that Negroes can receive a square deal...And if the leaders, voted into office, do not stick to their promises, then they should be voted out.\"",
