	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Carlo Rossello, construction worker, 73 Muller Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 11, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in the schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\" answer reads: \"I don't think so.  I know a lot of kids who are not interested in school, and I think that this is the result of the lack of a good instruction and encouragement from the teachers.  And I know a lot of other kids who love to go to school but the teachers never pay any attention to them, therefore, many of them lose interest.\"",
