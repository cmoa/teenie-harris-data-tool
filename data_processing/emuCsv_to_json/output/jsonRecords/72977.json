Carper, Waynesburg College student and Mr. Art Johnson, department store porter, Hill District, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 7, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision against prayer in public schools?\"  Mr. Carper's answer reads: \"I believe the Supreme Court used a constitutional basis for this.  Religious freedom is one of the vital things in the construction of our democracy.  Under no conditions should it be compulsory for anyone to have to participate in any sort of religious ceremony.\"  Mr. Johnson's answer reads: \"I don't think it was right.  A little prayer will do all of us more good than harm.\"",
