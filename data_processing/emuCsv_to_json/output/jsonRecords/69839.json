	"CatDescriptText": "Ella Wilson, college student, Mt. Lebanon and Rae Komaniak, housewife, McKees Rocks, were part of the Pittsburgher's Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 18, 1960 with question: \"Do you think that economic status, race, or religion influences court decisions in civil and criminal cases?\" Ella Wilson's answer reads: \"I believe it does.  It can't help but enter into the thinking of people, because they have a lot of pre-conceived ideas about races, religions, and groups...It is hard to separate these personal feelings and to be objective instead of subjective.\"  Rae Komaniak's answer reads: \"From what I know, it certainly does... No wealthy man has ever been condemned to die, although many poor people have.  In the lower courts I do think that juries are affected by religion and this is brought out by the fact that we, the Jehovah Witnesses, have had to take about 41 cases to higher courts.  However, there, the higher courts ruled in our favor.  I think that race also enters into lower court rulings.\"",
