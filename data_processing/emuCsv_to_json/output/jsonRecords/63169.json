	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Earnest Harris, car inspector and father, of 2409 Wylie Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 21, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: \"Increased taxes to benefit the schools is something which is almost inevitable. And I don't think that the taxpayers will oppose an increase in taxes, because they do not want anything to happen to their children.  Conditions in the schools are so bad that there is nothing that can be done in a highly beneficial and corrective way if there is not an increase in taxes.  I think that if a vote was held today on whether taxes should be increased or not for the benefit of the schools, the taxpayer, althought he is up to his ears in taxes already, would approve the increase for this purpose.\"",
