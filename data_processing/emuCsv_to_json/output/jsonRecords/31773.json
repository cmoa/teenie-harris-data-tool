Thomas said that because one hoseman was seemingly slow, he snatched a hose from the fireman and screwed it on the fire plug as he is doing in the right photo.  Thomas, who like other families, was forced to flee the blaze which took the lives of four members of a family, said he called at three different intervals for fire department help.  Chief John Morinzi of Braddock Fire Department denied any laxity.  His hoseman said that they lost some dear friends when the Fletcher youths died. - Harris Photo.\"",
