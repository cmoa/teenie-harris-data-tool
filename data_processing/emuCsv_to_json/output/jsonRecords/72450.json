Sands, headwaiter, East Liberty, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 24, 1962, pg. 8 with question: \"Do you think Pittsburgh Negroes are justified in being angry at the failure of city officials to appoint a Negro as police inspector, in spite of repeated appeals to grant them representation at this level of law enforcement?\" Mr. Walker's answer reads: \"Yes, I think so. We have to stand together on things like this.\"  Mr. Sands' answer reads: \" I think we ought to show them what we think by boycotting them and voting for the other party in the election.  It's an insult, that's what it is.  They deliberately waited two years for this man to qualify when there were qualified.  Negroes who could have done the job.\"",
