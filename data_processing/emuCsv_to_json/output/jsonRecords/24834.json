Army and Camp McCoy, Wis., Wednesday, members of the 645th Combat Engineers National Guard Battalion were busy for nine days packing up. In the first photo members of the group gather around while they tune up some of the automotive equipment of the group. There was a lot of heavy lifting to be done also, as is shown in the second photo, as members of the unit lift some of the crated heavy equipment under the guidance of an officer. Crates were made by hand by the National Guard members themselves and wired and nailed together as is shown in the third photo. Then they were carried to trucks for shipment as is shown in the last picture. - Harris Photos.\"",
