A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: \"In my candid opinion, the taxpayer would not oppose the raising of taxes, because it is our children whose lives are in danger in various parts of the city and the country as a whole.
