Holliday, 1918 Bedford Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 22, 1958 with question: \"Do you think that the current price of $1.50 for a haircut is too much to pay? Do you favor tipping the barber?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I think that the dollar and one half which is paid for the haircut is too much.
