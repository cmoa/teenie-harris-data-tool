In these photos, the top three from the Pitt Photo Library and the other by Teenie Harris, the contrast between the old home from which these youngsters were removed because the home was unfit for human habitation and the spick and span quarters of the model home at the Bedford Dwellings is spotlighted.  The model home was furnished by a downtown furniture store in honor of its late president, Leo Lehman, who from 1941-46 was vice chairman of the Pittsburgh Housing Authority Board.  The model home, with its attractive budget-priced furnishings, will be open to the public until Bedford Dwellings is completely occupied in September.\"",
