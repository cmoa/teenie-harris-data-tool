Wright, 8355 Bricelyn Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 1, 1958, pg. 9 with question: \"Do you believe in corporal (paddling) punishment for students, in the elementary grades, who misbehave? If so, who should mete [sic]  out the punishment-- the teacher or the principal?\" answer reads: \"I must say yes, because I came up that way myself and so did my children.  I think that the teachers should bet he one who deal it out because they are familiar with the situation, day-in and day-out.  And the reason is because the children should know what discipline is.\"",
