	"CatDescriptText": "Viola Jones, telephone operator and Sadie Wilson, department store worker, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\"  Answer reads: \"It shouldn't be essential for us to pass laws.  If our boys can stand side by side and fight in wars, they should have equal economic and social status in our country.  I think that the problem can be solved by educational and intellectual means.  I think that when anybody is forced to do something, there is no gain.  Instead there is an increase of tensions.\"",
