	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Julia Coleman Young, teletype operator, Homewood and Mrs. Dorothy Goolsby, housewife, Carnegie, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, March 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Negroes over-emphasize \"social life\" as it pertains to entertainment?  If so, can you suggest a remedy for \"curing it.\"  Mrs. Young's answer reads: \"We don't, but instead, we place the emphasis in the wrong places.  More stress should be placed on entertainment along the fine arts line.  We should have more group discussions about books, the political situation, and other phases of cultural life.\"  Mrs. Goolsby's answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  We're about average with other persons.  Everybody needs to relax.  Perhaps we should relax more than others because we work that much harder to make a living.\"",
