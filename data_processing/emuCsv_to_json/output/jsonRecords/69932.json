	"CatDescriptText": "Wilbur H. Barbour, mail clerk, Chicago and S. G. Amoroso, railroad worker, Mt. Washington, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 18, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe that Patrice Lumumba, deposed Premier, was a good or evil influence on the Congo, in his quest for the natives to rule themselves?  Do you believe his slaying was justified?\"  Mr. Barbour's answer reads: \"I have believed that there were communistic tendencies in his actions, and this has been more or less borne out by the Communist attitude towards his imprisonment and downfall, and their attitude at the present time in regards to his death.  The Communists are engaged now in an apparent attempt to capitalize on the fact that a number of people are stirred up because of his death.  If they can achieve what they feel is proper, you will see a lot of bloodshed in the Congo and sympathy demonstrations in this country, and in other countries where the Communists have a tendency to dominate.  I don't believe that the Communists dominate this country, but they are trying to take the Congo case and make it appear that their attitude is better than ours in regards to the situation there.\"  Mr. Amoroso's answer reads: \"The majority of the people in the Congo wanted him, therefore, he must have been all right.  The slaying was wrong.\"",
