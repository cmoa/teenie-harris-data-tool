This is an earned reputation.  The public determines who these leaders are.  They observe, and they make their own leaders.  The man who can measure up in every way is a leader.  This is why William Frederick through hard work, honesty, and a heart for the people in all economic levels is now operating one of the largest, most efficient funeral services in Pittsburgh area today.  He has a \"never stand still\" attitude in facilities and services.  In operating today's modern funeral services; adequate parking areas, casket salon at the establishments are a must.  These he has.  Chapels seating 200, air-conditioned white limousines, spacious slumber rooms and areas for fraternal services-these Frederick has.  He planned them for those he serves and rest assured as any other advanced or modern technique of preparation or service appears on the scene Frederick will make an effort to have or learn it.\"",
