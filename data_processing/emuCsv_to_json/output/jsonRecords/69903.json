	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Wilbert Crowell, North Side and Mrs. Luther Davis, Terrace Village, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you favor legislation or voluntary (appealing to the souls and conscience of men) methods, like arbitration, mediation, persuasion, etc., to obtain civil rights for minorities?\"  Mr. Wilbert Crowell's answer reads: \"They should say 'Yes, sir' and 'No, sir' but they shouldn't be forced.  If force is used, they say the 'heck' with saying 'Yes, sir' and 'No, sir'.\"  Mrs. Luther Davis' answer reads: \"I think that forcing them to say it makes them rebellious.  It's a thing that should come naturally from people.  It's taught in the homes by the manners of the elders in the home.\"",
