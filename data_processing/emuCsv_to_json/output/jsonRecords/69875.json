	"CatDescriptText": "Marise Ellison, college student, St. Clair Village and George Baggott, photographer, Shadyside, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 9, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Whom do you think the Democratic and the Republican parties will choose for their respective presidential candidates? Why?\" Ms. Ellison's answer reads: \"Kennedy will tie the Democratic candidate, because he is their best man.   And the same reason holds true for why the Republicans will choose Nixon.\"  Mr. Baggott's answer reads: \"Nixon will probably be the Republican choice because he's Ike's favorite, and the most popular candidate the Republican party has.  The Democrats probably will nominate Symington.  I look for Kennedy to come very close towards winning the nomination, but it will be somebody besides him and that somebody, I think, will be Symington.  He's the next strongest, and a Southerner who is more liberal than Johnson is.  What I would really like to see is a Democrat elected to the presidency who will place Chester Bowles in a prominent office in order to straighten out many things.\"",
