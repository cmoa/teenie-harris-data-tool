	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. J. Ball, 4411 Chatsworth Street, Hazelwood, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 20, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the police department states more raids in Negro neighborhoods than in white areas, because there is more crime in former districts?\" answer reads: \"I don't know, but I'm certain that it is not because of police want to give the Negroes more protection. I feel that the reason why is because that anything nasty, dirty and mean that they can think of, they attempt to smear the Negro with it.  It seems that this is the poorer section, the section down by the river or down by the railroad tracks, where the Negroes are forced to live, is where the most crimes been.  If the Negroes were allowed to move into the better neighborhoods instead of being denied the right to do so, there would not be as many police raids in those areas as there are now.\"",
