A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should be 'militant' in their fight for civil rights or pursue a course of 'sitting down, talking and seeking a working plan for obtaining them without vigorous pressure?\" Answer reads: \"I actually believe that everybody should stand militantly for civil rights.
