Taylor, 463 Domestic Street, Republican, 26th Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 7, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Who is your Ward Chairman? Does he have any power? Does he exert it?\" Mr. Bailey's answer reads: \"Oh, gosh, it's a shame to say it, but I don't know the ward chairman.  Yes, he does have the power to get things done.  He does exert that power because I've seen things accomplished in 34 years that I've been around here.\"  Mr. Taylor's answer reads: \"William H. Braun who's also a county detective, is my ward chairman.  And he has quite a lot of political influence and the power to et things done for the people.  He does exert his power and is pretty well thought of in this neighborhood where he was reared.\"",
