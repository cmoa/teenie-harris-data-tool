A1, with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\"  Answer reads: \"I think that they are a little worse in my particular neighborhood.  My opinion is based on observing the kids travelling back and forth from school and some people who are now moving into the neighborhood.  As to why things are like this, I think that politics have a lot to do with it.  The politicians and law enforcement officers allow many bad things to flourish.\"",
