A1 question reads: Do you think religion will play a major part in the choosing of the presidential candidate? If so, why?\" Ellis's answer reads: \"There probably will be, but there shouldn't.  The reason is because many people have religious prejudices.  They look on religious differences in the same light that they view racial differences.\" Claybourne's answer reads: \"I don't think that it will interfere...I believe that the best man will win and the victory will not be based on religion, but on how the candidate stands on other issues.\"",
