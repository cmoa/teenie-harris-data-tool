	"CatDescriptText": "Charles Cramer, salesman, Spring Street, North Braddock, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 15, 1959, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"Fifty per cent of the confessed first-degree murderers should go to the chair. I would say that 25 per cent are sick and don't receive proper treatment, or rather I would say, should have had treatment before.  Perhaps the reason they did not receive proper treatment when they were in jail before is because of the lack of facilities and the lack of interest.  The reason I don't think that all persons who murder should be sentenced to the electric chair is because I feel that anybody who takes up a gun needs mental treatment.  HOwever, in cases where the criminal is just bad at the core, I think that if he is a first-degree murderer, society will benefit from his elimination.\"",
