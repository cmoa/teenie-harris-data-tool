A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice.

Really, a law is not needed.\"",
