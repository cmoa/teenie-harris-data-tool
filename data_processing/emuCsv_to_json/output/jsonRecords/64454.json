A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower is as popular today as he was when he first was when he first took office?  Why?  Do you think that the fact that he is not running for office will influence the election?\"  Mr. Donville Scott's answer reads: \"He is... He's doing a lot to help foreign countries.  Without Eisenhower as a candidate I think that the Democrats will have a better chance.\"  Mr. Bob Adams' answer reads: \"Yes and the popularity is because he's a good boy.  I don't think his not running will have any influences.\"",
