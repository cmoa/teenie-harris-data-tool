	"CatDescriptText": "James A. Brice, postal worker, Beltzhoover and Ronald Gray, stock clerk, Terrace Village, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 17, 1960, pg. 11A with question: \"Do you think Negroes choose their own leaders or are they chosen for them by someone else?\" Mr. Brice's answer reads: \"We don't choose our own leaders like Councilmen.  We don't stick together on the actual vote and don't back our candidates.  The Negro in the North is behind the Negro in the South in this respect.\"  Mr. Gray's answer reads: \"I think our leaders are definitely chosen by someone else.  And the reason is because when Negroes are asked to choose their leaders, they tend to shy away, believing they don't think they have the power to do so.  They don't realize that they have the capacity to choose their own leaders.  Negroes don't know their capabilities on this score.\"",
