A1 with question: \"What do you think is the number one problem for city officials to solve in the redevelopment program?  Why?\"  Mr. Blum's answer reads: \"The biggest problem, which should be attacked, is high taxes.  I say lower those taxes and bring wages up, because the cost of living is too high.\"  Mrs. Traylor's answer reads: \"As to which is the number one problem, it is extremely hard to say, because it seems to me that everything is needed to be done.\"",
