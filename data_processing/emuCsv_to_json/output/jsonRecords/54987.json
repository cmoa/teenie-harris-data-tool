Just now, Mrs. Wynn, is forced to herd her family into a single room.  Shown in upper left is the small sink which is the sole source of water for the family, and on the right is the single burner hot plate which compromises the cooking facilities and the open gas burner in this single crowded room where eight people must eat, bathe and sleep. Below is Mrs. Wynn and five of her seven children: Bobby, 2; Mrs. Wynn and Louis Eugene; Elmer, 10; Elmira, 12; and Richard, 6.  Three year old Patricia and Frederick, 11, were away from home when these pictures were taken. - Harris Photo.\"",
