The Debonnaires sent Ronald Howard to camp for two weeks in 1960. Last year, the members donated linens to the Aged Ministers and Laymen's home, on Oakwood St., and this year the club sponsored a Shamrock Ball, from which proceeds will be used to purchase a life membership in the NAACP. Here Justine Allen, president of the Debonnaires, presents a check as a payment on the life membership, to Lu Davenport, while Emma Mosby, Nadine Mosby, Marguerite Mosby, Agnes Reynolds and Elouise Morris look on. - Harris Photo\"",
