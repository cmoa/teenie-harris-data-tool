Do you believe that they should hold public office?\" Robert Wells' answer reads: \"Yes, I think it's all right for a minister to be in politics as long as it doesn't interfere with his service to the church.  And I think that it is all right for him to hold public office.\"  Mary Kearney's answer reads: \"No, I don't think that a minister should be active in politics.  The reason is that if they have time for politics, they will not have time for the church.  They are supposed to concentrate on religion.\"",
