	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Theodore Ketchum, 1414 Wylie Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"I think that the congregation should pay the minister a cost-of-living salary and maintain rent-free quarters. I also approve of paid vacations.  I feel that the vacation is necessary.  He is entitled to it by virtue of his services.\"",
