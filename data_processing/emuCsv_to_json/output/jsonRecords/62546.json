	"CatDescriptText": "Leo Newman, 587 S. Negley Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 4, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that Sherman Adams was guilty of misconduct in office of assistant to the President? Do you think that he should have resigned?\" answer reads: \"All I know about the case is what I've read in the newspapers.  Some say he is guilty, while others say he is not guilty.  And still others say that he did only what others are doing.  In my opinion, I think that as far as what he was accused of having done, I don't think that he was wrong.  It happens every day.  Sellers do it for buyers, and buyers for sellers.  As for Adams, well I think that it is pretty late in life for him to start doing something underhanded.",
