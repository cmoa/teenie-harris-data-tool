A1 with question: \"Do you believe in the old-fashioned \"woodshed\" reprimand or the \"talking things over with the offender\" type of discipline as regards the correction of youngsters guilty of misdemeanors?\" Mr. Weinmann's answer reads: \"It is better to talk it over.  A talk hurts more than a beating.\"  Mr. Skiles' answer reads: \"Personally, I think the old woodshed method is the best... and the law prohibiting beating by parents should be amended.  However the parent should not go to extremes.\"",
