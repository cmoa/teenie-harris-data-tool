	"CatDescriptText": "Benjamin Lewis, unemployed, 92 Roberts Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 31, 1959, pg. 32, with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment? If so, do you think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\"  Answer reads: \"No.  I do not believe in capital punishment.  And the reason is my religion.  I'm a members of the Church of God in Christ.  I believe that a person should be tried and sentenced for brutal crimes, if convicted, but the death penalty should not be inflicted.  In my opinion, it is all right for a person to be sentenced to life in prison.  And, in that way he will pay many times for his crime.\"",
