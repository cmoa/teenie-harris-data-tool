	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Grace R. McCray, widow, Garfield Hill and Mrs. Gerry Bell, college sophomore, Chicago, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 10, 1960, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you favor governmental (state or Federal) aid to education, which would help promising students further their educations, or do you believe that the rising cost of education should be defrayed entirely by the student, his or her parents or relatives?\" Mrs. Grace R. McCray's answer reads: \"If the student is worthy and promising, and the parents run into difficulty in trying to finance the education, then the Government should help, but should not give all.  This should be done because the students are part and parcel of our tomorrow.\"  Mrs. Gerry Bell's answer reads: \"The Government should help when the parents are not able to send the child to college...I believe there's a lot of college material which is not getting into college and especially so among the colored people.  These persons and their families cannot afford the costs.  With these students pursuing a higher education, I believe that the educational level and our Government's stature will be raised.\"",
