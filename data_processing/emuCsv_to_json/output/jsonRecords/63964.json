	"CatDescriptText": "Scandrew Robinson, steel mill worker, 250 Burrows Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 15, 1959, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"I do believe in capital punishment, and that a man should be treated the same as he treated the other person. If its is first-degree murder, the judge is not giving society the proper protection when he gives a man a life sentence, and this man is out on parole in 10 or 12 years.  The judge should carry out his duty, and if the sentence calls for the chair, then he should be sentenced to the chair.  As for how society benefits from the electrocution, I say that this is the law, a portion of which is in the Bible.  And it's the law of this country.  For instance, in spying, a spy who worked against his government is sent to his death, and since we have the same type of sentence for first-degree murder, the same penalty should be carried out.\"",
