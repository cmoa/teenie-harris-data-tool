A3 with question: \"Do you think Bible reading in public schools is constitutional or unconstitutional?\" Mr. Morris Kaufman's answer reads: \"According to the recent ruling it is unconstitutional, but I can't say for sure because I'm not well versed in the matter.  I can't say whether it's right or wrong.\"  Mr. Samuel Yimin's answer reads: \"I think it's all right because if the people don't have religion, they will go out and murder and do other crimes.  This way, with Bible reading, there is a fear of the law.\"",
