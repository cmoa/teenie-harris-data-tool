Because it afforded shade, the citizens said that some of their number built some tables and benches for use by elderly people and mothers who desired to sit and watch (as a safety precaution) their children at play nearby.  However, they added, some borough officials \"objected to this, and ordered the tree cut down.\"  They warned that the act may have political repercussions. - Harris Photo.\"",
