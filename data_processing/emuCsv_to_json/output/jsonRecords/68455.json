	"CatDescriptText": "Donna Wissenbach, Whitehall and Michael McCarthy, student, Aspinwall, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 16, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"What role, if any, do you think the United States should play in the present South African situation?  Do you think United Nations' intervention is enough?\"  Ms. Wissenbach's answer reads: \"We have enough problems in the South.  I don't think that we should bother with others until we have settled our own problems.  I don't know about UN action.\"  Mr. McCarthy's answer reads: \"I feel that the situation is out of hand there.  As to what we can do, I don't know because we have the same situation here.  The UN action is a positive step in the right direction.\"",
