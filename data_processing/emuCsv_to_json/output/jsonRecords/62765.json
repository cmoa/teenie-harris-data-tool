A1 with question: \"Do you think that too much leniency is shown teenagers who commit crimes?\" answer reads: \"In my opinion, there is not enough leniency shown to teenagers who commit crimes. I think there should be more rehabilitation and less punishment.  If the state can afford to have camps for the wayward children, they, in this way, can eliminate delinquency.  Right now, the first thought which enters the mind of correctional authorities when teenagers are convicted of a crime, is to send them to some penal institution like Camp Hill or Morganza.  And I might add that I believe that we should do some preventative work before the teenagers commit crimes.\"",
