	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Toni Regis, Butler and Miss Esther Williams, Board of Education worker, Morgan Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you favor legislation or voluntary (appealing to the souls and conscience of men) methods, like arbitration, mediation, persuasion, etc., to obtain civil rights for minorities?\" Miss Toni Regis' answer reads: \"No, I don't.  I think that teen-agers should have manners just like anybody else.\"  Miss Esther Williams' answer reads: \"No, I do not.  To be courteous is not something that takes away from a person, but adds to his character.  And you can be courteous while asserting your rights.  And being this way gives the elders more respect for you, than showing brass and signs of the lack of good breeding.\"",
