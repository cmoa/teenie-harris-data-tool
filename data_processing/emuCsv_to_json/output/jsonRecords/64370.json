A1 with question: \"In your opinion, what effect on the community do interracial churches have? Do you believe this type of membership should be encouraged?  Why?\" Miss Martha Lyon's answer reads: \"Discrimination makes you sick.  God created us all equal.  If Negroes are good enough to fight in the Armed Forces, they are good enough to live with us ...Interracial churches certainly should be encouraged, because the country which prays together, stays together.\"  Miss Judy Stewart's answer reads: \"It's the best thing in the world and definitely should be encouraged.  We all are equal.\"",
