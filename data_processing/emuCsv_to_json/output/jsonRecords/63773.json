	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Harvey Davis, salesman, Mt. Lebanon, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 11, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in the schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\" answer reads: \"It depends on the location.  As far as the city schools are concerned, they, in the past, had adequate counseling.  This however, is based on my educational experience, which was about 25 years ago.  And the reason it was inadequate was because of costs and small amount of money available.  counseling was one of the channels which school funds were not devoted to.  I'm not familiar with the school situation today.\"",
