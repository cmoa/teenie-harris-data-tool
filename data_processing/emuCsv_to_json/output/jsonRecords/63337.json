A1 with question: \"Do you favor an increase in state sales tax or a graduated income tax as a means of raising revenue for a commonwealth of Pennsylvania?\" answer reads: \"To be frank with you, I don't want either one. HOwever, if the money is really needed, I think that an increase in the sales tax would be better because people only have to buy the necessities and do not have to purchase those luxury articles which would be taxable.\"",
