	"CatDescriptText": "Henry Alexander, 7447 Monticello Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 13, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the hospital service rendered under Blue Cross plan is worth its present cost to the subscriber? Do you think the rates should be raised?  Why?\"  answer reads: \"I think that Blue Cross is a good plan.  I intend to have it in future.  I heard a woman say that the service was not worth the price which was not worth the price which was being paid for hospitalization.  What she was beefing about was the proposed increase in the Blue Cross rates.  I, myself, do not think that the proposed new rates are justified.\"",
