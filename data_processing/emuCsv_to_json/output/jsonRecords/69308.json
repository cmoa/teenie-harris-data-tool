Whalen, artist, South Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 3, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that integration in all schools in the South should be effected immediately, or do you favor permitting a reasonable length of time?  If so, how long a period do you consider as a \"reasonable length of time?\"  Mr. Conway's answer reads: \"The fact that we have integration is wrong... If we believe in Christ, we are not supposed to tolerate anybody, but to love everybody...As things now stand, the schools should be integrated within a reasonable length of time...May I add that the Negro should be congratulated on what he is doing to achieve equality in the South.\"  Mr. Whalen's answer reads: \" A reasonable amount of time should be allowed.  And this would benefit both colored and white citizens.  Integration should be slow, because if it is fast, the people, who are not of the highest intelligence, will resent it that much more...Yes, it should be slow but it should be done.\"",
