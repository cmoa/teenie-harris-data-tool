It is cold in the snow, but it would indeed be wonderful if the warmth for all mankind that abounds in children's hearts at this season of the year could be transferred on a year-round basis to adult hearts, or be carried into their homes and businesses so that the 'Peace on Earth, to Men of Goodwill' of which the angels sang on Christ's birthday might become a mode of life for all. - Harris Photo.\"",
