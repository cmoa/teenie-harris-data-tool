A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so, because the Sabbath is the Sabbath and is supposed to be respected as such.  As soon as Sunday begins, this respect should begin.  There are six other days in which people can clown, but on the Sabbath, the people should behave themselves and go to church.\"",
