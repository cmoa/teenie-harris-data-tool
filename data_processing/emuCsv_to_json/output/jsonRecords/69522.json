A1 with question \"Do you believe the people who vote only for the President every four years make the best citizens?\"  Mr. Hauser's answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  When most people vote in the other elections, it's because they or others want political jobs.  This is not so when you vote for President.  Then you're voting to place the best man into office\"  Mr. Frye's answer reads \"I don't think so.  The people should vote for every election because it is a duty of citizenship.\"",
