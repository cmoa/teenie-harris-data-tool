	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Henry McGuire, hotel keeper, North Braddock and Mr. Ed Merriman, life underwriter, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 30, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the Christian Church is doing an effective job in improving racial amity in the city, nation and throughout the world?\"  Mr. McGuire's answer reads: \"The church does have the lead.  Everything is stimulated from the church.\"  Mr. Merriman's answer reads: \"Here in Pittsburgh, to the best of my knowledge, I think the churches are.  However, it stinks in the South.  Throughout the rest of the country, the churches are doing pretty good.  And on the international level.  I might say that I think they are trying.  The question now is getting together and trying a little harder.\"",
