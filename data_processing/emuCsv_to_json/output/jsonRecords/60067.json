	"CatDescriptText": "Calvin Clark, salesman, Crafton, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 23, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike?  Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" answer reads: \"I personally do not think so and the reason is the realization that a steel strike would be terrible for business in general.  As to whether or not wages should be frozen, I say that my salary is frozen like that of other white-collar workers.  If we all just sit tight for a while, the adjustments will take care of themselves.\"",
