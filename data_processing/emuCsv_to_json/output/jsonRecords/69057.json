If so, in what grade do you think they should be taught first?\"  Mrs. Bernice Reinert's answer reads: \"I don't think it would hurt.  It could be done, but I don't think we have had race problems.  As I say, it could be taught and maybe around the fifth or sixth grade, because children at that age are beginning to look around and see what differences there are among them.\"  Mr. Francis Carragher's answer reads: \"I think they should be taught.

Perhaps high school would be better than elementary school...\"",
