	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Leroy Smith Jr., steel chipper, Hill District, and Mr. Wilbur Ringgold, painter, Hill District, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 24, 1962, pg. 8 with question: \"Do you think Pittsburgh Negroes are justified in being angry at the failure of city officials to appoint a Negro as police inspector, in spite of repeated appeals to grant them representation at this level of law enforcement?\" Mr. Smith's answer reads:\"I think Negroes should realize that it's going to take a lot for them to move up in the world. In Pittsburgh, they shouldn't make too much of a fuss or expect to accomplish everything at once, for then there would be chaos.  If they can't get what they want at first, they should try again.  They can't lose all the time.\" Mr. Ringgold's answer reads: \"I think they should be angry.  After all, this is America and there shouldn't be discrimination.  People of all races work in other branches of government in good jobs, and I don't see why the police should be any different.\"",
