Ciotti, boiler engineer, McKeesport and Wilbur Bradburn, insurance agent, Oakdale, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 12, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"If you were President of the United States, would you appoint a Negro to the cabinet?  Do you think there is a Negro or Negroes qualified for a cabinet post?\"  Mr. Ciotti's answer reads: \"I would if the person were qualified for the job, and I have no doubts that there are Negroes who are qualified.\"  Mr. Bradburn's answer reads: \"If he were qualified, I see no reason why he should not be appointed.  And the appointment should not be just because of his race but because of his ability and knowledge.  As for qualified persons, I think there are Negroes who are just as qualified as others.\"",
