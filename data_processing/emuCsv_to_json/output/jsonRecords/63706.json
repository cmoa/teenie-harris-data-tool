	"CatDescriptText": "Ethel Tate, high school junior, 423 Robinson Court, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"They are more influential today.  One example of this influence is Pittsburgh's Fair Housing Act, which enables colored as well as others to live where they desire and can afford...I think newspapers are influenced in news coverage and presentation.  There are wrong reports, at times.  These could be mistakes, but i think it results from influence.  One example of this was a recent incident at Schenley High School.  Newspapers reported that boys started to beat city workers and hit one with a brick.  But that's not the way it was.  The only newspaper, to report the incident accurately, to tell how the boys were chased with sticks by the men, was The Pittsburgh Courier.\"",
