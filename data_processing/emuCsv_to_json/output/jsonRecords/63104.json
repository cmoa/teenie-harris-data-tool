A1 with question: \"Do you think Negro business places should have the right to operate in Lower Hill after that section has been beautified?\"  Answer reads: \"Yes, and the reason for my opinion is that the section will be a nice part of town for businesses. It is close to downtown and favorable not only to the Negro but to all others.  A lot of people from out-of-town will be coming to that section to shop.\"",
