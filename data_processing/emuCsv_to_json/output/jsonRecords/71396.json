Woodall is billed as the 'World's Greatest Human Kite,' and once flew across Lake Erie.  Hobbling on crutches, after suffering fractures of both legs, in a kite crash, Woodall, the father of five, dived into Lake Erie and saved a drowning motorboat skipper.  The feat won him the Carnegie Medal.  He is the main attraction at the Boat Show, and especially makes a hit with the children. - Harris Photo.\"",
