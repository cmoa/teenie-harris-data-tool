Luck, stock clerk, Aliquippa and Cleo Berry, Fairview, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 13, 1960, pg. 29 with question: \"Do you think that married students of high school age should be permitted to attend school with other students who are single?\"  Mrs. G. Luck's answer reads: \"It depends on how much the persons want an education.  A married person, who is not intent on getting an education, should not be there.  The grades will reveal whether or not the persons are intent on getting an education.\"  Cleo Berry's answer reads: \"Definitely not.  If they are grown-up mature enough to take up the responsibilities of married life, well, they shouldn't be in high school.\"",
