Yates, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 6, 1962, pg.7 with question: \"What goal or goals should the Pittsburgh Negro aim for in 1962?\" Mrs. Branda White's answer reads: \"I think they should try to do as good as they can under the circumstances now in Pittsburgh.  They should try to make the goals as high as possible.\"  Mr. H.H. Yates' answer reads: \"There are a whole lot of goals that the Negro should strive for.  For instance, the Negro should do everything he can to increase his membership in the NAACP.  There are so many other things that we should strive for such as better race relations.\"",
