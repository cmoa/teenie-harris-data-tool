And incidentally, I don't see why there has to be riots in the South.  Things should be like they are here, where people of different races get together and settle differences amiably.\" Mr. Eaglin's answer reads: \"The Federal Government should step in right away because in some states, Governors like those in Alabama and Arkansas may be biased.\"",
