	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Herbert Jackson, Greyhound Bus Co. employee, Fifth Ward, Mr. Courtney Graves, watchman, Junilla Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 22, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe Negroes in Pittsburgh are as militant about Civil Rights like others of their race display in other Metropolitan areas in the USA? Why?\"  Mr. Jackson's answer reads: \"We should look to see who;s running for office, then vote for the right person to help us to progress, but we are not progressing.  We are going too slow...There are some persons who would like to make it appear as though we are progressing, but this is not so, so far as jobs, or housing, or other things are concerned.\"  Mr. Graves' answer reads: \"I don't think so.  They figure that they will let the Southern Negro do the work, then they will sit back and reap the benefits.  However, we are, to a certain extent, helping them financially.\"",
