First, the 6' 8\" athlete signed a contract to play professional basketball for the St. Louis Hawks at a salary said to call for $10,000 a year.  Saturday he was married to his college sweetheart, pretty Margaret Ellen Mount, in Pittsburgh, and Sunday he was graduated from Duquesne.  It's figured Ricketts will sign a baseball contract sometime this week.  He pitches and plays first.  Dandy Dick is shown watching his bride accept congratulations from Lou (Doc) Skender, Duquesne Athletic director and baseball coach.
