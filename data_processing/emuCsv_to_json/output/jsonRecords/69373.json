Spring, creative designer, Shadyside and William Scheble, retired, 27 Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 12, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"If you were President of the United States, would you appoint a Negro to the cabinet?  Do you think there is a Negro or Negroes qualified for a cabinet post?\"  Mr. Spring's answer reads: \"I would judge on qualification and not color.  I'm not in a position to identify the qualifications.  There may be some who have the stature but I don't know that much about them.\"  Mr. Scheble's answer reads: \"I think I would because they have as much right as anybody else.  We're all Americans...I imagine there are a good many Negroes qualified for cabinet posts...\"",
