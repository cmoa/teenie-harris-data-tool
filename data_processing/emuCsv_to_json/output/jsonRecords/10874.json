Rick Oilman Saves Day for 'Fat Man' - Pittsburgh, Pa. - Arthur Oursley, Pittsburgh's 401 pounds of once unhappy fat man, at the week's end was beginning to have cause to be renamed 'the happy fat man.' It all happened when he had cause to appeal for a pair of pants to fit his nearly sixty-six inches of girth.  Unable to work because of a glandular condition, Oursley, who lives at the Improvement of the Poor Dormitory, partially supported himself by selling pencils in downtown business section...that is until he ran afoul of the lay for plying his precarious trade in front of a business established on the beat of an unsympathetic cop.  Appeal Heard.  His appeal for a pair of pants also included the request for an overcoat for the this winter.  It appears now that he will get his paints, and he might have changing clothes for the first time in a long while.  Multi-millionaire Oilman Michael Benedum has ordered him a pair and employes [employees] at a downtown store are going to make him a present of an overcoat.  And, on top of that Mrs. Robert L. Vann, Courier president and publisher has seen to it that the fat man has a license to sell things on the street.  To all of which Oursley said last week: 'Thank the Lord.  Bless all of the persons who are going to help me.\"",
