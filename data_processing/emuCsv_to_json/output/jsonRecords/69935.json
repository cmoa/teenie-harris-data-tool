	"CatDescriptText": "Melvin Brown, postal worker, Homewood and Ernie Sesto, boxing referee, Bellevue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, June 11, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that all bingo games, including those for the benefit of churches, veteran's groups, or hospitals, should be outlawed?\" Mr. Brown's answer reads: \"I don't think it should be outlawed for the simple reason that the games are entertainment and relaxation.  People go to bingo games to win, but they also want relaxation. This is especially so for women.\"  Mr. Sesto's answer reads: \"No, I don't think all should be outlawed.  Those held by and for charitable institutions, which result in money being given to charities, should or could be continued.  But the professional bingo promotion should be outlawed.\"",
