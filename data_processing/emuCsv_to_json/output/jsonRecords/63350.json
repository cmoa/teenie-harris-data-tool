	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Ruth Turner, housewife, 553 Aiken Street was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 28, 1959, pg. 1 with question: \"Do you think that education standards should be the same throughout the city school system or should they be lowered in order to accommodate the slower-learning pupils, particularly those who suffer the handicaps of poor home or neighborhood environments?\" answer reads: \"No, I think that there should be special classes like we already have in our schools. The so-called average child should not be slowed down in his learning by the slow learner, because it just isn't fair.  I think that you always are going to have the educational standards varying with the different areas.  But I do believe that the amount spent per pupil should be the same regardless of the area.\"",
