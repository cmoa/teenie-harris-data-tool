Lebanon, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 13, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the hospital service rendered under Blue Cross plan is worth its present cost to the subscriber? Do you think the rates should be raised?  Why?\"  answer reads: \"I have not kept up with the increases, but, perhaps, there are some abuses, judging from what I've heard.  There are reports that some doctors send patients too the hospitals who really don't have to be sent.  I like the $100 deductible life insurance better, which I now have.\"",
