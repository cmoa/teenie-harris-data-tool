	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. \"Bud\" Brown, former Homestead Grays player, for 19 years, 1810 Webster Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 13, 1958, pg. 2 with question: �What do you think of young men or boys who process their hair? Do you think it improves their appearance or not?� answer reads: �I don�t think anything of it.  The best thing to do, in my opinion, and that is regardless of who the person is, is to wash the hair with soap and put something soft on it like vaseline.  Like the care of the hands and the body, nothing feels better on the hair than this care.  Such things like a process makes the hair tight.  The hair should be washed, cut close, and brushed.�",
