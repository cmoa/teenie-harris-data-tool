A1 with question: \"Do you think students are learning as much under the modern methods of teaching in public schools than students did years ago under the 3 R's (the old teaching method)?\" Miss Mary Ann Rushak's answer reads: \"I don't think so.  The teachers seen to not teach as much as they did in the past and seemingly don't have as much interest.  Also, teachers were stricter in the past.  I think this was better.\"  Miss Betty Claramelia's answer reads: \"I think there are more books and they are better.  And if the teachers don't teach the subjects right, the books are so good that you, yourself, can learn from them.\"",
