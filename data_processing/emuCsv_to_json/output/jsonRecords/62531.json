A1 with question: \"Do you think there is any racial tension in Pittsburgh? in neighborhood where you live?  If so, what do you think causes it?\" answer reads: \"The beating of a colored man by several whites a short time ago, and other incidents similar to this could be the start of something which would be very bad for Pittsburgh.
