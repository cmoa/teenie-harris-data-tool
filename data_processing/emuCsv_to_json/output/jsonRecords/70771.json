Butko, railroad employee, West Mifflin and Louis Munizza, Locust Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 28, 1961, pg. 21 with question: \"Do you favor legislation or voluntary (appealing to the souls and conscience of men) methods, like arbitration, mediation, persuasion, etc., to obtain civil rights for minorities?\" F.G. Butko's answer reads: \"If it's a law, the people may lean more towards doing the things required.\"  Louis Munizza's answer reads: \"By legislation.  I believe that if it's written in the law and is compulsory, you won't be bothered by different groups trying to tell you what is right.  If there's legislation, it will be cut and dry as to what is right.\"",
