Say, about 500 more?\"  Mr. Brown's answer reads: \" The cops should be getting more. If it takes a little more wage tax, then you will have to pay it.\" Mr. Howard's answer reads: \"Additional police are needed, but I wouldn't increase the wage tax because it's too hard now on persons who draw low wages.\"",
