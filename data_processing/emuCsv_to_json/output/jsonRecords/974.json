Unlike many other adults in the area, Constable Smith not only is a generous financial backer of such projects, but he is never too busy to spend time with his little friends in their quest for wholesome recreation.  Parents consider him an active leader and not a 'lip-service' one in the community. - Harris Photo.\"",
