If so, at what grade should the teaching of these courses begin?\" answer reads: \"I do think that the subject should be taught to children no younger than at the age of 13.  At that age they will know what they are doing.  By teaching them these things it will keep them from the pitfalls of life, because if they go wrong, it's pretty bad.\"",
