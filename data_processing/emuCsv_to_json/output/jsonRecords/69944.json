	"CatDescriptText": "Yvonne Burner, waitress, Beechview and Gayle Simons, student, Mt. Lebanon, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 18, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe that Patrice Lumumba, deposed Premier, was a good or evil influence on the Congo, in his quest for the natives to rule themselves?  Do you believe his slaying was justified?\"  Mrs. Burner's answer reads: \"I don't know exactly, but I will say that if he was communistic-bent and a friend of Russia, and I believe he was, he was no friend of mine...The slaying was not justified.  You are not supposed to kill anybody.  There should have been a judgement.\"  Ms. Simon's answer reads: \"I think he was a very good influence.  I think that people should have as their leader a person who understands them and wants to do the best for them. Somebody, other than a person like this, who is put into office, is just carrying out basic laws and doesn't necessarily have the will of the people at heart.  His slaying was very bad and it probably will cause a lot of trouble. No slaying is justified when a leader is speaking the will of the people.\"",
