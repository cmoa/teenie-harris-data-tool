	"CatDescriptText": "Ethel Gregg, housewife, Hill District and James Lee, chauffeur, Whiteside Road, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 17, 1960, pg. 11A with question: \"Do you think Negroes choose their own leaders or are they chosen for them by someone else?\" Mrs. Gregg's answer reads: \"They are chosen by someone else.  So far we haven't developed enough real leadership.\"  Mr. Lee's answer reads: \"I would say that in a broad sense, the leaders are picked for us.  Recently with a group of friends, I have discussed this matter.  We concluded that the Negro has the power to vote into office whomever he pleases, but we don't think it will ever come to pass because we won't stick together.\"",
