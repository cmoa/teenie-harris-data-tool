Williams, 2332 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 30, 1958, pg. 3 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes make full use of their voting franchise by registering and voting in both the primary and the general election?\" Answer reads: \"No, too few of us do not exercise our voting rights. We just do not take advantage of them enough.  It is not easy to say how it would be if we did exercise these rights.  As an example of the fact that we do not exercise the rights, I refer to a time when a Negro ran for City Council in Pittsburgh and only missed by about 20 or 30 votes.  If the Negroes had turned out, he would have won.\"",
