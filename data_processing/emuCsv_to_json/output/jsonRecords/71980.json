	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Scott Ray, student, Brushton and Mr. Aria Kea, Miller Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 16, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the so-called 'store-front' churches, and those who are known generally as 'self-styled preachers,' are an asset or a liability to the community.\" Mr. Scott Ray's answer reads: \"It could be either.  It depends on the neighborhood and the type of people there.  In general, I think the 'store-front' churches are liabilities, because they are 'put on'.\"  Mr. Aria Kea's answer reads: \"They are benefits to the community.  For young people walking by, it's easier to come into church.  All you do is just walk in.\"",
