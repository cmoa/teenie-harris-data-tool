It would be better if there was one system of streets, water, government.  We would get better service.\"  Mr. Williams' answer reads: \"Yes.  I think Los Angeles has this sort of plan, as do many other cities.  Eventually all the large cities will adopt it.  Pittsburgh, the same.  At least it would ease the burden on the transportation system.\"",
