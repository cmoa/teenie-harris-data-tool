Do you think trolley fare rates should be increased?\"  Mrs. Berger's answer reads: \"The street car service from Castle Shannon and Library to Pittsburgh is real nice.  I don't think there should be a fare increase because it makes it too hard to get the change.\"  Mr. Griffin's answer reads: \"Sometimes it is dependable and other times it is not.  Fare rates should not be increased.  The person working in such jobs as hospital work, just can't afford it.\"",
