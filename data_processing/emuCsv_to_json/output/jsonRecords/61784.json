Day, 1835 Bedford Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 7, 1958, pg. 3 with question: \"Do you think adults in the community are doing enough to foster constructive recreational activities, like playgrounds, centers, places to dance, Little Leagues, etc., for youth?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so. Take Ammon Center for instance.  There are too many people using the services of one pool.  Here in Pittsburgh we are a little behind.  For instance, in Wilmington, Del., and Philadelphia, where I lived, they have teen-age dances every night and Saturday they are televised.  The parents just have to look at television to know where the kids are.\"",
