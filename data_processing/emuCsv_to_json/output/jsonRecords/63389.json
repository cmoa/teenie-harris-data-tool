Johnson, manager of the Harris Grill, 7418 Hermitage Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 28, 1959, pg. 1 with question: \"Do you think that education standards should be the same throughout the city school system or should they be lowered in order to accommodate the slower-learning pupils, particularly those who suffer the handicaps of poor home or neighborhood environments?\" answer reads: \"The educational standards should not be lowered, but there should be an accommodation for those persons who cannot learn too fast. There should be special classes in the school, and the students should attend these special classes.  Perhaps by spending one extra hour a day in the classes the children can overcome the home environment and thereby want to learn.  The teachers of these special classes should be specialists.\"",
