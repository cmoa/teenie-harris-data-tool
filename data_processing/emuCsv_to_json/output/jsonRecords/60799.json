	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Rose Anderson, 7711 Bennett Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 30, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Does the financial aid, given young married couples by parents, encourage or dissuade the latter's realization of marital responsibilities?\" answer reads: \"Sometimes it helps, and other times it hinders. In some cases the aid causes trouble because the givers want to tell you what to do with it.  Generally, I would say that a young married should not receive aid.  Let them get out and do for themselves and learn to do it the hard way.\"",
