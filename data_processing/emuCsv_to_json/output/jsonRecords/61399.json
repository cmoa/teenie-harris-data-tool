The picnic, a circulation-promotion project, under the supervision of A.D. (Jake) Gaither, circulation manager; William Clyde Page, promotion manager, and William G. Nunn Sr., coordinator, was acclaimed a huge success.  Assisting the aforementioned were Leroy Randalll [sic], Carl Davis, Lloyd Tobias, and Donald Williams, distributors, who were mainly responsible for the large turnout.  James D. Drake, promotion art director, acted as co-chairman of the program activities, along with Mr. Davis.  Others who volunteered their services as attendants were Mrs. Bernice Price, Mrs. Lloyd Tobias, Miss Valerie Stewart and Minister Robert X. Davenport of Muhammad Temple of Islam No. 24.  Plenty of good food, baseball, volleyball, and football games, assorted foot races, swimming and rock and roll music kept the newsboys and girls busy throughout the day.  Pictured above are...(5) Leroy Randall Jr., left, program assistant, and several thirsty newsboys look on as Mr. Drake and Mr. Davis ready the Pepsi-Cola dispenser.  Gallons of ice cold Pepsi-Cola were donated by the Pepsi-Cola Company.  Other food items on the menu were appetizing hot dogs (Armour Star wieners from the New Diamond Market and buns from the Drake Baking Company) with all the trimmings, plus Reick's Sealtest ice cream, all flavors...Three large Pittsburgh Railways buses transported the newsboys and girls to and from the park. - Photos by Harris.\"",
