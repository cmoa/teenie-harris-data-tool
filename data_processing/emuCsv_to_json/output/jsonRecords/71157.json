Magram, attorney, Point Breeze and Dolores Henderson, housewife, 2405 Chauncey Dr., were part of Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 13, 1960, pg. 1 with question: \"What are the most appealing and least appealing aspects of the Democratic Presidential candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy?\"  Mr. Magram's answer reads: \"I think that Senator Kennedy is brilliant and a very able individual and is representative of the liberal element in our country.  The fact of his youth and inexperience in executive capacities in Government office may detract from his popularity.\"  Mrs. Henderson's answer reads: \" I really have not formed any real opinion concerning him but so far I have not seen anything that would make me really dislike him.  So far as I'm concerned, I would say that right now, I would say that he will make a pretty good President.\"",
