	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Arthur Carter, laborer, Hill District, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 18, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"I don't think so.  As it is now, they close at 12 midnight Saturday night and are closed over the weekend.  To change the system would mean that the taxpayer would have to pay more in passing new legislation.  And to sell beer and wine on Sundays would do more harm than good.  That way, workers may overdo their drinking and as a result, might not be able to work on Mondays.\"",
