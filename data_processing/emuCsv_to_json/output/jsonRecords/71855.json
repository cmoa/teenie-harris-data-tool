	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Jessie Gunn, college student, McKees Rocks and Mr. Bernard Gregorious, bus boy, Downtown YMCA, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 29, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that laws should be made and enforced to eliminate segregation and discrimination, or should education and \"moral persuasion\" be used instead?\"  Ms. Gunn's answer reads: \"I say education and the law, but definitely not moral persuasion.  The education should begin with the child in kindergarten.  And the law is for the older persons.  The reason, I say not by moral persuasion is because once a person has grown up with certain ideas in his head, you just can't change them be saying this is wrong.  There has to be a law.  This also holds true not only for persons who don't like colored people, but also for those person who would discriminate or segregate mainly because of fear of what others are going to do.\"  Mr. Gregorious' answer reads: \"Moral persuasion.  If people get down to thinking more about church and religion, then they wouldn't have the desire to think in terms of black and white and segregation.\"",
