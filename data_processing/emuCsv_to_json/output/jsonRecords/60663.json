	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Edward Fulse, 6417 Carver Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"I think that the congregation should pay a cost-of-living salary. However, the minister shouldn't have rent-free living quarters, but since he's getting a salary, should have to take care of it the same as you and I.  The minister should get a vacation with pay, since everybody else who works gets one.\"",
