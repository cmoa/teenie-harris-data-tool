A1 question reads: Do you think religion will play a major part in the choosing of the presidential candidate? If so, why?\"  Evans answer reads: \"No, because the candidate is not elected because of his religion, but on his merits, and what he has to offer.\"  Gallagher's answer reads: \"I don't think so.  I don't think that religion today plays any part in the election.  I think that the religious issues have been played up too much by the opposition.\"",
