A1 with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\" answer reads: \"I think that he should be treated as a guest. And I'm not saying this because the President suggested it.  It's because I think it's ridiculous the way people are treating him.  I think we should treat him hospitably as a guest and listen to what he has to say.\"",
