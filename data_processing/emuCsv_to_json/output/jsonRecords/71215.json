	"CatDescriptText": "Edna White, housewife, Schenley Heights and John Slater, barber, Schenley Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 17, 1960, pg. 11A with question: \"Do you think Negroes choose their own leaders or are they chosen for them by someone else?\" Mrs. White's answer reads: \"We Negroes here in Pittsburgh select our own leaders.  An example of one of these leaders we have chosen is Rev. Charles H. Foggie, head of the local NAACP branch.\"  Mr. Slater's answer reads: \"We definitely do not choose our own leaders and this is very bad.  An example of this fact is the recent appointment to City Council of James A. Jordon.  Although he may be the best man, the people did not get their wish.  The Democratic administration ignored the will of the people and appointed whom they wanted.\"",
