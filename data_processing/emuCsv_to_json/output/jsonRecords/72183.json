	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Mame Dozier, housewife, Elmore Square and Mr. Ben Lee, laborer, Fifth Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 3, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that in custody cases a child should be awarded to the mother, even though she may be of questionable background?...Or do you think they should be placed in a foster home, with visiting privileges being granted to the parent?\"  Mrs. Dozier's answer reads: \"I think that regardless of the background, the child is much better off with the mother.  And you don't know about the background of the foster home.  There you're taking as much of a chance if not more than leaning the child with his parents...\"  Mr. Lee's answer reads: \"If the mother is not fit, there's no better place than a foster home, and especially so, if the child doesn't have a mother and a father, because the kids can't bring up themselves.  Either place them into a foster home or allow them to be adopted by families with good backgrounds.\"",
