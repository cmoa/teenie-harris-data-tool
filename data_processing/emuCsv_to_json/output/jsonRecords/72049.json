Bagley, machinist, Wilmerding, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 9, 1961, pg. 5 with question: \"Do you think that in the final analysis, the uncommitted darker nations will join the democratic (pro-Western) or Communistic bloc?  Why?\" answer reads: \"I think they will join the democratic nations, because democracy believes that everyone contains a certain amount of honesty, and desires equality and goodwill for everyone.  This is what democracy stands for whereas the other regime is that for a one sided government where you either toe the line or you're not in.\"",
