	"CatDescriptText": "George Davis, unemployed, Hill District was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 16, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"What role, if any, do you think the United States should play in the present South African situation? Do you think United Nations' intervention is enough?\"  Answer reads: \"Because of what is going on in the South, we can't play too much of a role...In fact, the situation here is worse than South Africa when you consider that there the people are uneducated while here the Southern Negroes who are being mistreated, are well-educated...UN intervention should be stronger, strong enough to effect an end to the brutalities.\"",
