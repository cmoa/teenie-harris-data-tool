	"CatDescriptText": "Victor Cianaca, patrolman, 2329 Birtley Street, Brookline, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"They do in many fields.  For instance, in politics, the news reports on candidates sway people into voting for whom they think is the best candidate.  Newspapers crusade today by editorials, and get things done if it's a touchy subject, and the editorial's well written.  Yes, newspapers influence public opinion and, some times, not in the best way.  For instance, there are the recent articles on the Mafia.  By creating the stereotype that all Italians belong to the Mafia, if such an organization exists, the articles, to some extent, may have wiped out the solid accomplishments of many Italians, among them, my father, who came to this country with three strikes against him.  However, by hard work and honest living as an American citizen, my father raised his family and accomplished a lot more than people here, living off the fat of the land.  Because it plays a great part in influencing public opinion, the press has a tremendous responsibility...As to freedom of the press, no matter what happens, it hits the paper.  Nobody keeps it out.\"",
