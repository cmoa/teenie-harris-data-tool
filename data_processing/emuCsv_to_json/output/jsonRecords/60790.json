	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Frank Thompson, 6440 Frankstown Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 30, 1957, pg. 3, with question: \"Does the financial aid, given young married couples by parents, encourage or dissuade the latter's realization of marital responsibilities?\" Answer reads: \"I don't think that financial aid should be given by parents to young married couples.  The persons getting married should have enough responsibility to get out and work.  I think that aid by the parents hinders the assumption of the responsibilities.  Because you've been with your parents from the day you were born.  I think that when you get married you should get out on your own.\"",
