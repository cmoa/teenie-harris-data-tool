A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should be 'militant' in their fight for civil rights or pursue a course of 'sitting down, talking and seeking a working plan for obtaining them without vigorous pressure?\"  Answer reads: \"If you can't get along and don't have your civil rights there should be some discussion to find out why. I think to use actual violence or physical force is wrong.  However, because this is America and we live under the Constitution, I think that militant legal force is all right.\"",
