A1 with question: \"Do you believe fares would be lower and service better on trolleys and buses if the city owned and operated these services?\"  Mrs. Harris' answer reads: \" There's a good possibility that the city could run the trolleys and buses at a cheaper rate and give better service.\" Mr. Branson's answer reads: \" I suppose that the fares would be cheaper and the service better if the city operated the trolleys and buses.  And the reason, is because it wouldn't be so much a matter of profit, but an operation by the city, at cost, for the benefit of the riders.  however, I don't think the rates would be reduced a whole lot.\"",
