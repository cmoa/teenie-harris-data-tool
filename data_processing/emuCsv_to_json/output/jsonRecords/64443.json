A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower is as popular today as he was when he first was when he first took office?  Why?  Do you think that the fact that he is not running for office will influence the election?\" Miss Ruth Cole's answer reads: \"I'm afraid his popularity is still as great.  And it's incredible!  The reason, well the Eisenhower smile.  It's almost unbelievable!  He creates the image that he is for good things... His not running will help the Democrats.  Whoever the Republicans nominate, he will not be able to run on Eisenhower's coattails.\"  Mrs. Ruth Parker's answer reads: \"Eisenhower's trip seems to bring back the popularity.  Republicans will have a hard time getting another person as good.  So, his not running is just made for the Democrats.\"",
