Malone spent almost three hours in familiar territory on Tuesday night, relaxing with loyal Republicans at Crawford Grill Two in Fifth Ward. He told the group, consisting of over three-fourths of elected city and county committee members, that he had kept his promise with decent people made in1951, to crack down on rackets, and would be re-elected by a bigger majority this year.  He reminisced about places and people in the Fifth Ward, where he was born and reared, and appeared throughly relaxed and happy throughout the evening.  The \"casual visit\" to Grill Two was arranged by David Thompkins, Republican chairman, and Lu Davenport, candidate for alderman.  Two of Malone's ace detectives, Walter Rainey and Alvin McNeal, handled seating arrangements to the comfort and satisfaction of everybody who attended.  Mr. and Mrs. David Thompkins, as host and hostess, chatted with each of the committee members and inquired about their comfort and pleasure - including food and beverages...Thoroughly relaxed, District Attorney James F. Malone Jr. (lower right) tells a story about income taxes.  Seated beside him is Fred Mathias, chief of county detectives, and directly in front are Mrs. Mae Walser and Estelle Baber, vice chairman of he Fifth Ward Republican Committee.  The Courier's John L. Clark listens to Malone's tax story...Harris Photos.\"",
