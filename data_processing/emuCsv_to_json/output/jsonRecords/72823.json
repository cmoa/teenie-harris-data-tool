Rawlings, director of employment agency, Penn Hills, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 7, 1962, pg. 12 with question: \"How do you think the Pirates will do in 1962?\" Mr. John Zolak's answer reads: \"That's a big question.  I'd be afraid to answer it one way or the other.  There's too many 'ifs' involved.\"  Mr. William L. Rawlings' answer reads: \"They didn't do so well last year, and there's no reason to believe they will do any better this year.  I doubt that they will end up any higher than fifth place.  One reason is that the newcomers have no incentive to aspire to play certain positions because the same stagnant players like Hoak, Groat and the rest already have them.\"",
