	"CatDescriptText": "William Humphrey, 1522 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 5, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Which do you think people give priority recognition to, the acquisition of money or achievement?\" answer reads: \"To be frank with you, money is the number one thing today. It used to be a time when other things were more important, but today, everybody is desiring financial security, including myself.  And that's mainly because we live in a capitalistic system, in which we can't hardly afford to do without money.  Therefore the recognition goes to the man with the money.\"",
