	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Lynnard Slaughter, sanitarian, Homewood and Mr. Leroy Lowry, administrative assistant, Oakland, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 8, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that women should wear Bermuda or walking shorts, or similar apparel, while walking along the streets?\" Mr. Lynnard Slaughter's answer reads: \"Generally speaking, I think it depends on the shape of the woman.  Some women know how to wear and dress correctly in shorts.  However, the wearing of shorts downtown is not a good idea.  The best places to me, seem to be the neighborhoods, around the house and in the parks.  In the neighborhoods, the people know you, whereas in the downtown area, they don't and are liable to say things about the person wearing the shorts.  And these things don't necessarily have to be true.\"  Mr. Lercy Lowry's answer reads: \"I think women should be allowed to wear shorts any place provided they are not the 'short-shorts.' I'm in agreement with the law in Alabama, which says women should be allowed to wear shorts six inches above the knee...Other than that it's all right for women to wear shorts any place....Shorts are cooler than other dress...\"",
