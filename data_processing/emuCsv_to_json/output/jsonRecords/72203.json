	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Russell Carter, porter, East Liberty and Mr. Alfred Butts, salesman, Wilkinsburg, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 27, 1962, pg. 12 with question: \"What is the most important issue confronting Pittsburgh in 1962?\"  Mr. Carter's answer reads: \"Mostly jobs, because it appears as though nobody can find a job, nobody is working, because most persons are not looking for jobs.  The jobs are there to find.  I know, because I have two jobs.  I think more people must forget their welfare checks and get out and look for jobs, because the jobs are there.  Perhaps, the state should slack down on the checks and that way people will stop laying that way people will stop lying back waiting for the checks.\"  Mr. Butts' answer reads: \"Transportation, because I think that we need to do something about it, because transportation is terrible.\"",
