Two brothers, Berry and James, and a sister, Jennie, were slaves on the same plantation. - 'Don't Touch Books' - Duke Finch first became aware of the restriction of bondage when he expressed a desire to learn to read and write. His master, William Finch married a school teacher, Miss Brinkley, who kept all the books in mansion under lock and key in the dining hall.

Under the Finch-Brinkley service the slaves were not permitted to do anything but 'work, hard work' sighed Mr. Finch recalling endless days of unceasing work in the fields of the large plantation .  'Bill Finch was a man though,' Mr. Finch grunted and smiled in remembrance, 'not even his high tempered wife could make him whip the Negroes.' ... he and his 82-year-old wife reside with a daughter, Mrs. Gertrude Jefferson...\" image published after event as part of his obituary in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 11, 1952, pg. 1.",
