After the genial fireman turned on the large cool stream on them from the hose, squeals of pleasure could be heard the length of the block.  The Webster Avenue Firehouse was fun headquarters that day.  Though not shown in picture, Fireman Watts was really the 'man behind the fun.' - Harris Photo.\"",
