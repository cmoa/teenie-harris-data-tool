Aiken Avenue were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 14, 1957, pg. 3, with question: \"Do you think that the City of Pittsburgh should own and operate its transportation system (street cars and buses)?\" Mike Middow's answer reads: \"Yes, the city should. There has been so much trouble that you have to take a taxicab or other means of transportation to work, therefore you are practically working for nothing.\"  Robert T. Jones' answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  The city should own it outright.  I've lived in cities like New York, where that is the case, and I might say that if Pittsburgh owned the transportation system, I don't think there would be trouble like we have almost every two years here.\"",
