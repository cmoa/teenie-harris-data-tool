A1 with question: �Do you think that the Pittsburgh Railways Company is justified in asking an increase in trolley fares?� answer reads: �Definitely not. Personally, I travel about a mile, not even a mile, just one stop.  And this trip costs a full fare.  For this reason alone, I�m against an increase which would raise the fares to 25 cents.  Also an additional reason is that we are receiving poor service.�",
