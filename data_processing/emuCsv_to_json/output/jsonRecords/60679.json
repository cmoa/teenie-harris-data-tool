	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Carole Adams, 3301 Iowa Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"Certainly, the congregation should pay a cost-of-living salary to the minister. I think everybody is entitled to that.  As for rent-free quarters, my opinion is that it depends on the congregation, what the people can afford, and whether or not this was made part of the agreement when the pastor was hired.  The same holds true for paid vacations.  As for special 'gratuity days,' I think it's all right to hold them if they have a meaning and purpose, such as an anniversary or achievement.\"",
