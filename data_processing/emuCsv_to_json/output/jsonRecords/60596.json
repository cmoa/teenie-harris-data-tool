Do you believe that they should hold public office?\" James Lewis' answer reads: \"No, I think that it is wrong for a minister to be active in politics.  Politics, in my estimation, is gambling, and no minister has the right to do that.  Politicians and ministry just do not go together.\"  Norman Peoples' answer reads: \"The way things are I think they should participate in politics.  More of our people, including ministers, should run for public office.\"",
