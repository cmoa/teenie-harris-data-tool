In 1951, Rawls and King had moved to 1617 Centre and renamed their business the B & M Restaurant.  The neon sign in the window promises 'Home Cooked Meals.'  Cars and pedestrians appear reflected in the building, probably faced in Cararra glass.  This image is cropped from a more expansive view of the street.",
