	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Taylor Thompson, TV-Radio serviceman, Wylie Avenue and Mr. Reginald Fuller, porter, Glenwood, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 25, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be held responsible, to the extent of being arrested, and fined, or imprisoned, (like the responsibility for their children's attendance at school) for the delinquency practices of their respective teen-age children?\" Mr. Taylor Thompson's answer reads: \"Yes, I think parents should be responsible.  If the parents were held responsible, we would have less juvenile delinquency....  The schools and other civic groups cannot correct juvenile delinquency without the help of the parents.\"  Mr. Reginald Fuller's answer reads: \"The parents have a lot to do with delinquency, because they are concerned with the rearing of their children.  I don't think, however, that they should be fined or imprisoned when the children are not in their hands.  A teen-ager does not necessarily do what he said he was going to do or go to a place he said he was going.  The child should be fined or punished, not the parent.\"",
