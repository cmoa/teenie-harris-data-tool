Their determination is strengthened by youngsters, some shown in the second photo, who long for 'their Sunday School.'  The North Side Federation Mission was forty years old at the time of the fire.  Among the original builders who are shown in the first photo are Mrs. Hallie Taylor (second from left), Mrs. Harris and her husband, John Sr. (third and fifth from the left), Mrs. Fairy Johnson (sixth from left), and William Clay, sitting behind Mrs. Johnson.  Others shown are white-haired James E. Bannister, Sunday School superintendent; Joseph Cook Jr., assistant Sunday School superintendent; Mrs. Lucille Rose, Mrs. Hamilton, Mrs. Marie Humphries, Mrs. Ella James Hamilton, Lojay Cook, Viola Brown and Ruth Champlin. - Harris Photo.\"",
