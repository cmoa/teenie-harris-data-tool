If so, who should build them--the individual citizens or the Federal Government?\" Mr. Forbes' answer reads: \"Yes, we must prepare for the inevitable.  We probably will have war, not an all-out war, but shill war.  The government should have the responsibility to build them because they have created the situation.\"  Mr. Dorn's answer reads: \"Yes, there is a need...It's better that the government build them,  because some individuals will not take the time to do so.\"",
