A1 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be imprisoned for the unlawful acts of their children (under 18 years of age)?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I think they should be. The reason is that if you're with y our children, you'll know everything about them and you'll know by their actions what they are doing.  It seems as though not very many parents know their children that well today, but they should.  That is the way my parents were and it was for the best.\"",
