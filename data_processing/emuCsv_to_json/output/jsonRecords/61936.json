Phillips, 128 Lincoln Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 3, 1958, pg. 1A with question: \"Do you think that the average family spends too much time watching television programs? If so, how has it affected family life?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that the average family does spend too much time watching television.  If they have anything better to do, they don't watch it.  I don't know about the kids of high school age.
