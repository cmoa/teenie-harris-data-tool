A1 with question: \"Do you think that cab drivers in general take advantage of other motorists and pedestrians in traffic? As a group, would you call them courteous or discourteous?\" answer reads: \"The average person greatly emphasizes small wrongs of cab drivers.  However, at times the cab drivers are irrigating.  But imagine how you would feel if you were competing all day long against other motorists, some of whom are somewhat stupid.  However, I would not say that the majority of them are discourteous.\"",
