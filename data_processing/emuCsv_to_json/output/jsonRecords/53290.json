Here under the leadership of Paul Cralle, dairy store manager, they begin to dig into debris in one of the five sewers clogged in one block, bounded by Gearing.  Sylvania, Montooth and Chalfont Streets.  The Rev. C. L. Butcher of St. Paul AME Church and the Rev. W. R. Harris of Beulah Baptist Church have also complained. - Harris Photo.\"",
