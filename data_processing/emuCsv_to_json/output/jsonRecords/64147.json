A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower should invoke the Taft-Hartley Act in steel strike?\" answer reads: \"In a way, yes, and in a way, no. There are some steelworkers who want to return to work, and there are a lot of others who do not want to return under Taft-Hartley.  I think that it would be the right thing for the President to do if he invokes the Taft-Hartley law, because if the steel strike continues, it will put everybody out of work.\"",
