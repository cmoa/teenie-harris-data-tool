Miller's famous 'Brownskin Models.[']  Known in off stage life as Bernice Tanya Bruce, this international star has kept the theatre-goers of two continents on the edge of their seats.  Photos of Tanya on this page show the flexible lady in several striking poses she assumes in her sensational SCORPION DANCE.  Apparently boneless, she writhes through her routine.  Born under Scorpia [scorpio], in the Zodiac, the little brown girl claims she came upon the idea of the dance by studying that sign, and applying her natural acrobatic art.  SHOCKING - was the term used by many who had seen Tanya's act, but those who see through her efforts an expression of art have dismissed the remarks of the puritans with a shrug.\"",
