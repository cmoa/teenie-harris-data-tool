Do you believe his slaying was justified?\"  Answer reads: \"I think he was an evil influence...Anything that Russia backs can't be much good to any people...As to whether or not the slaying was justified.  I might say that I think about the locality, and also the fact that it wasn't too many years ago that similar methods were resorted to here...It hasn't been too long ago since we indulged in such things ourselves.\"",
