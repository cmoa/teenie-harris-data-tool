	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Lois Medley, housewife, North Side and Mrs. Francis Wright, housewife, Schenley Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 7, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Red China should be admitted to the United Nations?\"  Mrs. Medley's answer reads: \"No, because it would result only in more confusion.  This admission wouldn't help the UN to solve any problems, especially the problem of the cold war...And China's admission wouldn't help us to keep tab on them, because there purpose would be to use the United Nations for their own advantage.  Therefore, we wouldn't learn anything.  Russia isn't helping us to understand her or to solve problems, and Red China wouldn't either.  It would merely add to the confusion.\" Mrs. Wright's answer reads: \"If ti's going to help to keep us out of war, to keep peace in the world, I say yeas.  But I don't think it will help.  If they agree with Russia, and it appears as though they do, they are interested in not preventing, but starting a war.\"",
