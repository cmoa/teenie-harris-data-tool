	"CatDescriptText": "Julia Mae Diggs, student Central State, Ohio and Reverend Edwin Mimms, minister, Herron Hill, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 8, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think there will be a Third World War?  If so, what do you think will be the cause or causes?\" Julia Mae Diggs' answer reads: \"It's really hard to say.  But the way things are going, there might be one.  I hope not.  I think that if it does happen, the reason will be that the countries are not understanding one another.  If they understood each other, things would work out all right.\"  Reverend Edwin Mimms' answer reads: \"Yes, because we haven't changed the pattern of behavior which led to the two previous wars.  The same path is being followed today.  This pattern of behavior is the disposition to regard others who do not agree as enemies to be destroyed.\"",
