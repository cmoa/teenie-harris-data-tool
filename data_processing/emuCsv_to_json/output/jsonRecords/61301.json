Does he have any power?  Does he exert it?\" Solomon L. Page's answer reads: \"I know my ward chairman who happens to be a woman, very well.  She is very efficient, in fact, at times, she worries me too much.  She makes certain that voters get out to vote.\"  Reverend Carey Jones' answer reads: \"I'm not registered to vote now, but I have been in past.  I've only been in this ward a short time and I don't know the ward chairman nor whether or not he has any power.\"",
