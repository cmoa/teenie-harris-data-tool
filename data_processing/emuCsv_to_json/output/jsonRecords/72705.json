	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Frances James, Western Union employee, Lawrenceville and Mr. George Rhodes, sales representative, Monroeville, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, May 26, 1962, pg. 8  with question: \"Should better medical care be provided for the aged through Social Security?\" Frances James' answer reads: \"Personally,  yes.  Nobody will give an elderly person a job.  Somebody has to take care of them.  They can't be left to die without any help.\"  Mr. George Rhodes' answer reads: \"Its a loaded question similar to the one when when did you stop beating your wife.  The reason this is so is because there's a lot of sentimentally connected with it.  People, in general, are inclined to favor such legislation, but on the other hand, we must always realize that such legislation is another step down the road towards communism, socialism, or some other 'ism.\"",
