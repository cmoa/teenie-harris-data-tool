	"CatDescriptText": "Geraldine Edmonson, 119 Bell Avenue, McKees Rocks, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 22, 1958 with question: \"Do you think that the current price of $1.50 for a haircut is too much to pay? Do you favor tipping the barber?\" answer reads: \"Yes, it is entirely too much in my opinion.  And the reason is that the men, especially my boy friend here, are not getting their hair washed, curled or straightened but just receiving a mere 'cut.'  Because of this, one dollar and fifty cents for a haircut just does not make sense to me.  And I'm not in favor of tipping because of the dollar and fifty cent price.\"",
