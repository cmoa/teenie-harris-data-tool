A1 with question \"Do you think there is immediate danger of a third world war?  Why? If so, whom do you think our allies will be?\"  Mrs. Johnson's answer was not published. Mr. Goodwin's answer reads: \"I would say that at this point there is not an immediate danger of war, but another incident similar to the one we just had probably will trigger a war.  With another U2 incident, I don't think that Russia will stand still, because it will hurt her prestige with the satellite countries.\"",
