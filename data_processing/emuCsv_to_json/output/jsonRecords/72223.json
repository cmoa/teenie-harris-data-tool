Schwill, construction superintendent, Crafton, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 27, 1962, pg. 12 with question: \"What is the most important issue confronting Pittsburgh in 1962?\"  Mrs. Douglass' answer reads: \"One of the most important issues is the providing of good schools.\"  Mr. Schwill's answer reads: \"I say a rehabilitation in industry like it was in 1940.  Prior to 1940, it was WPA projects which took up the slack as industry was not showing a profit.  We need industries to be brought into the area so that the government won't have to underwrite employment.  Another thing we need, and an important issue, is to guarantee a living wage without discrimination to anyone regardless of whether he is Jew, Gentile, Indian or of the Negroid race.  The problems can be taken care of by an acceptance of all the people to strive together for the benefit of everyone and by bringing new business into the area so that the government will not have to underwrite the economic situation heres.\" Mrs. Douglass' answer reads: \"One of the most important issues is the providing of good schools.\"  Answer reads: \"One of the most important issues is the providing of good schools.\"",
