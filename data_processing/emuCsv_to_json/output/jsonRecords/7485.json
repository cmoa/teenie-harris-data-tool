Commissioners William D. McClelland and Blair Gunther went out the front door to lunch shortly after this group arrived, about noon and sent back word that they would not return in the afternoon because they had another meeting. Commissioner John E. McGrady is at home recovering from a heart attack. - Harris Photo.\"",
