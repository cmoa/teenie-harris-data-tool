A1 with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\" answer reads: \"I don't see why we should not receive him hospitably. After all, he is a big official from the Soviet Union.  We should treat him that way, because their policy is the same in treating our visiting dignitaries.\"",
