An award of jurisdiction over his job to the Brotherhood of Railway Engineers will put him at the bottom of the seniority list.  John Early of Braddock, on the left, will also lose his job.  Cutbacks of main-line engineers jobs means that he and thirty-two other men who handle the engines in the yards will be 'bumped,' and by that means lose their jobs.  A strike of CIO Steelworkers Maintenance employes [employees], who service the Union Railroad, which does all in-and-between plant hauling for Carnegie Steel mills here occurred this week.  A Federal suit will be filed by CIO in behalf of the men's seniority rights. - Harris photo.\"",
