Lebanon, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 12, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"If you were President of the United States, would you appoint a Negro to the cabinet?  Do you think there is a Negro or Negroes qualified for a cabinet post?\"  Mr. Stauffenberg's answer reads: \"That's a broad question to answer.  It depends whether or not the Negro is the best qualified person available for the particular cabinet ...Right now, I can only thing of Dr. Ralph J. Bunche as being...of the Negroes who are qualified.\"  Mr. Hunt's answer reads: \"I would say that if the Negro is a competent, capable individual who could carry out the requirements placed on any cabinet office that neither race, or creed should have any bearing on the individual appointed to the office...One of the most prominent persons whom I think is qualified is Dr. Ralph Bunche.  I couldn't say what specific cabinet post he is best suited for, but it seems that he should be placed somewhere.\"",
