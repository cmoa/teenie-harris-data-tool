A2 reads: \"Fifth Ward Committeemen, Committeewomen Feted - The united leadership of the Regular Fifth Ward Democratic Organization, headed by Robert E. (Pappy) Williams, ward chairman, together with Councilman Paul F. Jones, Alderman Harry B. Fitzgerald and Constable Tommy Smith, played the role of host to the committeemen and committeewomen whose sterling efforts enabled the organization to win its smashing victory in the recent primary election. K. Leroy Irvis, legislative candidate, is on vacation and could not be present.  Even though invitations were sent to all committee members, according to \"Pappy\" Williams, all did not attend.  Four representatives of the \"Dave Roberts' camp,\" who are committee members, were present.  Others insisted that they were not invited.  Those who did attend, with a few friends, had a rousing good time because there was plenty of food, potables and jolly companionship, as can be seen in the above photograph, which was taken in the Terrane [sic] Room of the Hotel Terrace Hall, were Lew Herrington, owner, put out his best for the occasion. - Harris Photo.\"",
