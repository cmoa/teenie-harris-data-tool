	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. James Webb, porter, Homewood and Miss Madeline Roberson, stock girl, St. Clair Village, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 1, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment?  If not, what type of punishment do you suggest for those who commit what is generally termed \"vicious murder.\"  Mr. Webb's answer reads: \"No, I don't.  I go by the Bible which says, 'Thou shalt not kill.'  It shouldn't be left up to man to do anything like that. There should be some punishment, but as to taking another man's life, I don't believe in it.\"  Ms. Roberson's answer reads: \"I believe in it.  It isn't right of a human being to take another's life.  After all, we are all entitled to live.\"",
