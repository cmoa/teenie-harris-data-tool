	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Paul Blair, student, Wilkinsburg and Mrs. Bunny Corbitt, insurance company worker, Schenley Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 14, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think political leaders, who have been granted the power of seeking or dispensing patronage should \"take care\" of their immediate family and relatives before they do such supporters like committee men and committee women and financial contributors?\" Mr. Blair's answer reads: \"Those two classes should come after all the others are considered...They should be last.  Ability to do the job should be the prime consideration.\"  Mrs. Corbitt's answer reads: \"There are a lot of political people whose families are not too interested in polities.  So, therefore, first consideration should be given to supporters.\"",
