John Feehan (left photo, uniformed), and county patrolman Frank Costa (middle photo, extreme right), testified last Friday at a hearing before Alderman Frank R. Bruno (right photo, seventh from left), that Melvin White, 24 (right photo, sixth from left), helped to incite a riot on April 15 when Library Firemen denied Negro teenagers (left photo) admission to a disc jockey dance at the fire house. Atty. Everett E. Utterback of the NAACP LEgal REdress Committee, did not have White testify at this hearing, but probably will present White as a witness at next week's hearing before Alderman Harry B. Fitzgerald on anti-discrimination charges placed against Bastinanini and Library Volunteer Fireman Freddie Tobychek.  Squire Bruno fined White $10 after finding him guilty of disorderly conduct.  The Alderman reserved rulings on inciting to riot and resisting arrest charges filed by Bastinanini.- Harris PHoto.",
