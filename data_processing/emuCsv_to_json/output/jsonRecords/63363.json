	"CatDescriptText": "Laura C. Bailey, 2712 Bedford Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 14, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the recreational facilities for young people in Pittsburgh are adequate? If not, what do you think should be done about it?\" answer reads: \"No, there are not enough of these facilities.  I think mothers in neighborhood should become more interested in the welfare of the children and therefore do something about it.  About 85 per cent of the delinquency of children can be traced to their parents, who are not interested in them or are more interest in things....than taking care of them.  The costs of these ... facilities should be provided for by the parents and the city.  With this added help from the city, there would be good ...rounds and youngsters would be able to play softball, learn how to swim and enjoy other things.\"",
