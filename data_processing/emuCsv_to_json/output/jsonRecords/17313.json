Amidst a setting of pomp and pageantry that highly typified the splendor and charm that surrounds June weddings, Ira F. Lewis, Pittsburgh's newspaper, magnate gave his youngest daughter, Jayne Kaye Lewis, in marriage to Granville Woodson, of Washington, D. C., June 11 at Hi-Jar Manor in Pittsburgh's exclusive residential sector.  The imposing ceremony performed on the grounds of the Lewis estate was a virtual fairyland transplanted onto the rolling green-carpeted lawn, amidst a setting of fragrant flowers.  Seldom has any locale in the states been heir to such a marvelous wedding extravaganza. Aristocratic dowagers, and sophisticated debs and sub-debs with their husbands and escorts sipped multi-colored drinks and tasted of dainties on the lawn until the bride and groom departed.  Social prominents from all parts of the country were on hand to see the uniting of the son and daughter of two proud families, the Lewises of Pittsburgh, and the Woodson's of Washington, D. C.  Father Robert Brown, rector of the Holy Cross Episcopal Church, performed the wedding ceremony, Everett Utterback returned the honors by being best man for the bridegroom.  Adelaide Lewis, the sister of the bride, was the matron of honor; Elsie Stanton was the maid of honor.  Others in the bridal group were: Paul Woodson, Washington, D. C.; Dr. Charles West, Washington, D. C.;  Hayden Johnson, Washington, D. C.; Writt Richards, Pittsburgh, Pa. Richard Bell and John Woodson, of Washington, D. C. were ushers.  Debutant bridesmaids were: Alice Lindsay, Louise Jeffries, Ruth Buchanan and Dorothy Reed, of Long Island, N.Y., while little Iris Sapp was the flower girl and Bobby Lewis was the ringbearer.  The guest attendance ran close to three hundred admirers of the charming couple, and overcast skies did not dampen the spirits of the people who came out to see the town's most gorgeous wedding of the decade.  The newly-weds left shortly after the ceremony for a honeymoon in the East, returning to Pittsburgh in July. (Photos by 'Teenie' Harris).\"",
