George M. Leader, Democrat, and Congressman Hugh Scott, Republican, rival candidates for the U.S. Senate. Governor Leader cited his appointment of a Negro to a cabinet post and Negroes in other positions in the state government, also his speedy action in Levittown after a Negro family had been threatened by race-haters.  Congressman Scott pointed to his record of 16 years in Congress as a supporter of legislation to protect and help Negroes.  W. Beverly Carter Jr., Courier publisher, introduced Congressman Scott, and James A. Jordon introduced Governor Leader.  In the left picture, around the table, clockwise, are Mr. Scott, Mr. Carter, Miss Mable Turner, assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia; Mrs. Larue Frederick, the Rev.
