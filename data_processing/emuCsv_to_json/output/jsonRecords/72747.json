Palmer, city employee, Allequippa Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 28, 1962, pg. 11 with question: \"As a newspaper reader, what type of stories have the greatest appeal to you; In other words, which stories do you read first?\"  Mr. Johnson's answer reads: \"First I like the headliners, Crime pkrobably has the most interest for me.  Then I like the stories about the astronauts and our country's conquest of space and other things.\"  Mr. Palmer's answer reads: \"I like racial stories and the problems of Pittsburgh.  For instance, stories like the job situation - the breaking down of job bias.  Then secondly, I like stories about the Southern situation, the boycotts.  My third interest is stories about church...and especialy the one at Central Baptist Church.\"",
