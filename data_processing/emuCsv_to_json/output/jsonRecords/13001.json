Two such signs, plus one for a street car stop, are clearly visible in this block between Dinwiddie and Green Sts., diagonally across the street from the Centre Ave. Police Station.  Yet, car and truck drivers ignore them daily.  Some park, then go on Downtown, thus saving parking lot charges...- Harris Photos.\"",
