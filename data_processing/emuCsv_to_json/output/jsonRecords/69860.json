	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Elizabeth Simms, supermarket clerk, Terrace Village I and Mr. Bernard Spencer, singer, Sewickley, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you favor legislation or voluntary (appealing to the souls and conscience of men) methods, like arbitration, mediation, persuasion, etc., to obtain civil rights for minorities?\" Mrs. Elizabeth Simms' answer reads: \"In a way, yes.  I don't think they should say 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir', and so on.  I don't think it makes them feel exactly free.  And I think it's a dead issue, something of the past.\"  Mr. Bernard Spencer's answer reads: \"I don't think this should be forced, but should come under their own power.  Many do this.  It's only an honest way of showing respect to their elders.\"",
