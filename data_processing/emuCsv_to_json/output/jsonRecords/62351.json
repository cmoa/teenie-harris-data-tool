	"CatDescriptText": "Jul Trolani, 1295 Orangewood Avenue and Joseph Eddie, 1328 Rutherford Avenue, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1, with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" Jul Trolani's answer reads: \"What's wrong with the Pirates?  Well, some of the key players are in a slump.  Murtaugh is using his best players but he is not using them in best way.  If there were more coaching and more understanding of the men.  The Pirates would do better.\"  Joseph Eddie's answer reads: \"(who has hopes of seeing another game like the last game of the 1927 World Series where he as a hookey [sic] playing 'knotholer' had sneaked into the park, sat behind the dugout of the opposing club to cheer the Pirates to victory): Murtaugh seems to be pulling the same thing as Haney, in leaving the pitchers in too long.  He seems as though he does not know the pitchers well enough to know when they are not feeling good.  Also, he doesn't know when to pull players like Kluszewski.  Several times he should have pulled him and put in Stevens.  This may be good for the morale of the team.  Often when the team is in a slump, it is the rookie and not the dependable player who snaps the slump.  Murtaugh should put the rookies in so they can get a taste of blood.  Others do it, why not Pittsburgh.  Maybe he's afraid of the 'upstairs' the general manager and the same as Haney who once left a pitcher in the game after 18 runs had been scored.\"",
