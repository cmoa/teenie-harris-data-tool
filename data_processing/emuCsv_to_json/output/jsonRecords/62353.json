	"CatDescriptText": "Ronald Anderson, 969 Rivermont Drive, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1 with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" answer reads: \"The trouble seems to be something which the Pirates go through once a year.  I think that if the men on the field were changed around, it would help.  Some of the men on the bench could be playing and they probably could be doing as good a job as some of those on the field.  Baker and Stevens are two of the men who could be used.\"",
