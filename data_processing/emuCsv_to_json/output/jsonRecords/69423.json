	"CatDescriptText": "Clyde McIntyre, trucker, Scott Township and Joseph Donaghy, office manager, East Liberty, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 17, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"Do you believe that an accused person, scheduled for an appearance before a jury, is actually judged by a \"jury of his peers\" (laborers, housewives, rich, poor, Catholic, Jew of Protestant, Negro and white, Northerner, Southerner, Easterner or Westerner, etc.) or is the jury more or less handpicked to satisfy the whims of the prosecution and defense lawyers?\"  Mr. McIntyre's answer reads: \" I've never been in court and therefore can speak only from what I've read.  From reports, it appears that juries are picked by the attorneys.  Because both have an equal claim in the choosing of the jury, it turns out to be good.\"  Mr. Donaghy's answer reads: \"The jury is drawn from a panel from the defendant's peers.  This includer professional men, laborers, and others...That's our system which has been in effect for years...Nobody has found any that is better.  However, it's pretty hard, say for a defendant, who is a professional worker, to be tried before a jury composed of all professional workers or a laborer to be tried before a jury composed of all professional workers or a laborer to be tried before an all-labor jury...\"",
