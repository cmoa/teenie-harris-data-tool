Miss Doty, also a chorus member of Dusty's 'Harlem on Parade Revue,' which appeared all last week at the Casino, began editing the paper to create a diversion for the fifteen-member cast. The item on Dusty, however, is all in fun. Mrs. Jones is the wife of Dusty's son, also a member of the troupe.\"",
