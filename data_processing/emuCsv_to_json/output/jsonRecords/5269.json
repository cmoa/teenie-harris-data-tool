Yates Sr. (left), 39, of 3515 Beechwood Boulevard, seated with his family, Joseph Jr., 5 months, on his lap; Gloria Jean (Candy), 6; Mrs. Lois Yates, wife and mother, and Lois Jean 1 1/2, being held by her mother, before the television set which he (Yates) said he was watching the night Miss Ann Graham, white, 21, of 823 Lilac Street, charged that he molested her. The waitress claims she was attacked while on the way from her home to a grocery store in neighborhood, and finally identified Yates as her assailant, after two trips to the station house to view standups because she 'wasn't sure.'  Yates emphatically denies the charges.  Residents of the apartment, where Yates is employed as a janitor, describe the accused as being 'quiet, well-mannered, hard-working and devoted to his wife and children.' Yates has been released from jail under $4,000 bond.  - Harris Photo.\"",
