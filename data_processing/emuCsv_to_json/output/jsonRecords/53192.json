A1 with question: \"In the coming November elections, do you think voters should elect another Democratic Governor or change to a Republican?\" answer reads: \"As long as they don't get anybody in there who doesn't add more taxes, it will be all right with me. In other words, it doesn't matter who is in there as long as they are for the working man and will cut down the taxes.  As far as Republican or Democrat, I don't care who is elected as long as he is a good honest man.\"",
