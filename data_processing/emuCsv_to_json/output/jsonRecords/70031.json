Taylor, retired, Rochester, N.Y. and Miss Marge Hosek, model, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 2, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think religion will play a major part in the choosing of the presidential candidate?  If so, why?\" Mr. Richard H. Taylor's answer reads: \"It shouldn't be.  I imagine that it will because people are not broad-minded.\"  Miss Marge Hosek's answer reads: \"I think that religion might enter into the race because we have not had a Catholic President and Catholics are outnumbered.  It's not because of prejudice, I think, but because people will vote for their own religions.\"",
