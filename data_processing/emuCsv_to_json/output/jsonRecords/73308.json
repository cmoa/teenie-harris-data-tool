Next-door neighbors had warned police of prowlers on the premises, about 9:30 P. M., but a prompt police search was futile.  The smell of burning gasoline by Mrs. Albert C. Wynn, at 7030 Frankstown at 10 P.M. led her to turn in alarm. Firemen attacked the flames from two adjacent houses, both of which were damaged.  The destroyed frame house was owned by James T. Goode, who moved out of it four months ago. - Harris Photo.\"",
