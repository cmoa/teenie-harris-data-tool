Things along 'Deep Wylie' are going to get 'boring' and 'more boring' for the guys and dolls who frequent 'Pittsburgh's highway of hilarity' within the new year, as this piece of boring equipment at work at the corner of Wylie and Logan Street indicates.  Eventually, instead of the 'cats' digging this main Hill District traffic artery for 'high life' it will be bulldozers digging it for the high-lifts.  It's the beginning of the end. - Harris Photo.\"",
