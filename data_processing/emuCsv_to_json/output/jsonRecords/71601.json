If not, what type of punishment do you suggest for those who commit what is generally termed \"vicious murder.\"  Mr. Simpson's answer reads:  I do believe in it in some cases, for instance in the case of a gangster who would be better off out of this world.  And i believe in it for other persons who commit vicious and pre-mediated crimes.\"  Mr. Steen's answer reads: \"It depends on the cars as a rule, but as a general principal.  I don;t approve of i.  as I said, the circumstanced under which the murder was perpetrated would determine whether or not the death penalty should be used.  Generally, I don't think it solves too much.  It is were retained, it might make people think twice. But, no matter how you look at capital punishment, I don't like it.\"",
