Lebanon, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 3, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that integration in all schools in the South should be effected immediately, or do you favor permitting a reasonable length of time?  If so, how long a period do you consider as a \"reasonable length of time?\"  Mr. Williams's answer reads: \"They should be given a little bit of time to think things over...I have no idea just how long this should take, but it should be no more than a couple of weeks.\"  Mr. Denkhas' answer reads: \"They should wait about one year, and then let the people vote on it and see what they think about integration and whether they should have integration or not.\"",
