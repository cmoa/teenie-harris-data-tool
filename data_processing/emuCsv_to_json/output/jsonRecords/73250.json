At left (looking southwards) Mrs. Boggs stands between her sons, Dave and James, at the entrance to the dangerous and narrow land between the houses. The shot at the right was taken from the rear, and shows the crumbling chimney atop the ruin, from which the bricks are slowly falling.  Dale came charging through the danger lane as the camera clicked. - Harris Photo.\"",
