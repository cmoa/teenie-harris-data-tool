A1 with question \"Do you think there is immediate danger of a third world war?  Why? If so, whom do you think our allies will be?\"  Mr. Mulvey's answer reads: \"I don't think so, because neither side can afford to do so.  We know what Russia has, and they know what we have...Both sides realize that to start a war means the end of both.\"  Mrs. Robinson's answer reads: \"Yes, because they keep talking about it.  I'm talking about the word exchange between Khrushchev and Ike.\"",
