Hester, evangelist, North Side and Mrs. Lois Guy, church organist, Brentwood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 7, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision against prayer in public schools?\"  Mrs. Hester's answer reads: \"No, I don't.  As a God-loving nation, all public gatherings should have prayer as a part of them.  What has brought this about is the spirit of anti-Christ, which is trying to force prayer out of the world.\"  Mrs. Guy's answer reads: \"Yes, I do agree with the courts.  Separation of church and state has been basic in our country's history.  Also, we can look to the unfortunate events in many countries in which this separation has not existed.\"",
