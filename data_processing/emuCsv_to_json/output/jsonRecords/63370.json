	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. J. Wilkey, housewife, 816 Clarissa Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 4, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that theatrical productions like 'The Green Pastures,' which 'take-off' on religions, should be presented as entertainment?\" answer reads: \"I only was able to see part of 'The Green Pastures,' but am of the opinion that if was good, very good. Other religious take-offs similar to this one are good educational programs if your mind is open.  It leads to a better understanding of the Bible.  For instance, kids are told about the ark.  But in televised 'Green Pastures' they see the ark and thereby got a concrete impression of it.  I didn't object to any of the scenes, and this includes the whiskey scene between Noah and the Lord.\"",
