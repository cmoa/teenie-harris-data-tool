The batteau neckline of the gown was sprinkled with imported beads and pearls.  The bouffant skirt with tucked side drapings, was styled with a large silk rose at the back and ended in a chapel train.  Her veil was a finger-tip mantilla of imported tulle, and she carried a bouquet of white mums centered with a white orchid.  Mrs. Ann Galley served as matron of honor, Miss Rosalie Evans, younger sister of the bride, was maid of honor.  Other bridal attendants were: the Misses Ruth Mosby, Helen George and Mrs. Nelson Bliss.  They wore cherry-pink taffeta gowns with matching headdresses and carried white mum bouquets.
