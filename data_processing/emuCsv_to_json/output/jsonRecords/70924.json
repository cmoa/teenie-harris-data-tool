Persons in redevelopment areas should realized they have to move and should make some effort on their own to find a home.\" Ms. Evans' answer reads: \"Some agency should be responsible.  And when you say 'socially undesirable,' you have to ask why?  The answer is in the agencies which are supposed to keep people from becoming 'undesirable.'  Evidently, they must not be doing their jobs if this is the case.  In redevelopment areas, most single persons seek their own homes, but anyone appreciates help.\"",
