Davenport, Pennsylvania national Guardsman, 711 Wandless Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper December 19, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower is as popular today as he was when he first was when he first took office?  Why?  Do you think that the fact that he is not running for office will influence the election?\" Mrs. Jessie William's answer reads: \"I think he is as popular, because he has done a pretty good job.  I don't know what influence his not running for office will have.\"  Mr. R. Davenport's answer reads: \"No, I don't think that he is as popular.  Instead of creating goodwill in foreign countries, he should attempt to straighten out things here at home, like segregation.  He should go South on a tour and attempt to create goodwill there.  As for the election, I think that the Democrats will win because the Republicans will not have the Eisenhower popularity.\"",
