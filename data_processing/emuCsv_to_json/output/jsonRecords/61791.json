Do you favor tipping the barber?\" Etta Glanton's answer reads: \"Yes, I do, and the reason is that a man or a boy can buy clippers and then get somebody in the house to cut their hair for much less than a dollar and fifty cents.\"  Carol Vail's answer reads: \"I think that it is entirely too much to pay for a haircut.  At one dollar and fifty cents for one haircut, parents with large families have to pay out a lot of money.\"",
