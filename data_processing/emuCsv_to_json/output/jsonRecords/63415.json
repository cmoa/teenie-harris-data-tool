	"CatDescriptText": "Kenneth Dandridge, railroad maintenance worker, 264 Dalton Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 4, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that theatrical productions like 'The Green Pastures,' which 'take-off' on religions, should be presented as entertainment?\" answer reads: \"'Green Pastures' was more or less a lesson in religion which contrasted the Devil and God. As for Noah's attempt to get more whiskey, I think this helped the contrast.  Overall, I don't think that 'Green Pastures' was too bad, therefore I think that it was all right to present it in such a way.\"",
