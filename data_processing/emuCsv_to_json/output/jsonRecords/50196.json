Police found Mrs. Jackson still cooking in her second floor home.  Miss McConico was on her way up Soho Street from school and was about to cross Soho Street to enter her home when she saw the entire side of the third floor fall. - Harris Photo.\"   Accompany article reads: \"Here's a Lady Determined to Do Her Duty Even if the House Falls.  It takes more than the side of a brick house falling off to keep Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson, second floor, 51 Mahon Street, from performing her household duties.  When the Soho Street side of the third floor of her home crashed to the pavement below about 3:45 Wednesday afternoon amid a shower of falling building materials, Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson did not leave the house.  Centre Avenue police called to the scene were told by Katherine McConico, school girl who was about to enter the house when she saw the crash of bricks, that Mrs. Jackson was the only one home and was still in the building.  Six or seven policemen rushed hurriedly into the building to find Mrs. Jackson still cooking in her second floor apartment.  They ordered her to leave the building.  Mrs. Jackson and the McConico child were given shelter at the home of Mrs. Blair, 542 Soho Street.  The house is occupied by Richard Bryant and family on the first floor; and Mrs. Sarah Gardner, on the third floor where the side fell.  Neither Mr. Bryant nor Mrs. Gardener was home at the time of the accident.  Police said the property is owned by Centre Lumber Company.\"",
