Buckner Jr., alias James Weathers, 18, of 20 Granville Street, said to himself last Friday morning during a hearing before United States Commissioner Harold Lavine on a narcotics charge. Buckner was charged with being a \"delivery boy for Edgar (Beans) Smith\" and with having sold some heroin to a Federal undercover agent last August.  He was nabbed in recent Hill District narcotics dragnet.  So to protect \"his humility\" and embarrassment he tried to hide from the Courier photographer by pulling his jacket up over his head and while thus \"hidden\" tried to sign his bond of $5,000 under which he was held for Federal Court.  Inset, Buckner's face sans \"humility.\" - Harris Photo.\"",
