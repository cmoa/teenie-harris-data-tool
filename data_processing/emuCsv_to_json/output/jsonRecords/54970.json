The talented young musicians will participate with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in a new type of concert in which they will be matched chair for chair with the regular orchestra.  Henry Di Cecco, senior student at Central Catholic High School, will be junior concertmaster and be seated beside Samuel Thaviu, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concertmaster.  Fifty per cent of the junior musicians are products of the city's public, private and parochial schools, and fifty per cent come from the county school system. - Harris Photo.\"",
