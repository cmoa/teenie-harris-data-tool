Robinson, Pullman porter, Schenley Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 18, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe that Patrice Lumumba, deposed Premier, was a good or evil influence on the Congo, in his quest for the natives to rule themselves?  Do you believe his slaying was justified?\"  Mr. Shoffner's answer reads: \"It's a hard question to answer.  Lumumba seems to me to blow hot and cold...Ultimately, he was a bad influence...The slaying was definitely not right.\"  Mr. Robinson's answer reads: \"I think he was a good influence, as good as they have...No man's slaying is justified.  he was mobbed.  Every man should have a chance at justice, and not be put to death by violence.\"",
