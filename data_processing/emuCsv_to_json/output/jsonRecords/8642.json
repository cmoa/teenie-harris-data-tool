The Parent-Teacher Association of Vann School started things off with an ice cream treat at Vann School Wednesday, at which the children were served refreshments. Best of all was the visit from Santa Claus. The 'Spirit of Christmas\" is handing Santa Claus the magic bell. Little Linda Jackson sits entranced on Santa's knee as he tells her all about conditions at the North Pole. On Thursday and Friday plays were given and parties were held in different class rooms. - Harris Photo.\"",
