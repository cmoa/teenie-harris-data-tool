A13 with question: \"Do you think that the President of the United States should intervene in the steel strike, or should he wait, and then invoke the 80-day 'cooling off' period as prescribed in the Taft-Hartley Act?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think he should intervene. The issues should be settled by collective bargaining.  The 80-day 'cooling-off period' would eventually leave the situation just as it is now.\"",
