Volunteer fire fighters who joined regular firemen helped extinguish the blaze and prevent its spread to nearby property.  A number of firemen and others were injured fighting the fire.\"  Accompanying article reads: \"Fire Destroys Only Skating Rink With No 'Color Line' - Owner of Rink is Arrested After Woman Says She Saw Him Burning Rubbish; Rink Was Center for Dances and Parties - Interracial fair play in Pittsburgh was given a setback Saturday evening when fire of undetermined origin destroyed the Flamingo Roller Skating Rink at Larimer and Auburn Avenues, East End.  The Flamingo enjoyed the unique distinction of being the only large rink in city which did not draw a color line.  The nearby Lexington rink was allegedly organized on a club basis to exclude Negroes.  The Diamond Market rink, downtown, set aside certain night periods for Negroes.  Dance Center - Because of its 'open door' policy, the Flamingo rink had become a center for dances and other large affairs given by Negroes.  Many Negroes also went to prize fights held there...\" The Flamingo Skating Rink was located at 6241 Auburn Street, Julius C. Navari, proprietor, by 1945. It had moved to 219 Larimer Avenue by 1948.",
