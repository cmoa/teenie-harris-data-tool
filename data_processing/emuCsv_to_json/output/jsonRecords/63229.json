	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Mable Patterson, housewife, 407 Robinson Ct., was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 28, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\" answer reads: \"I think that the morals in my community around Robinson Court in Terrace Village, are worse.  When I moved into the project in 1945, it was a very nice place in which to live.  However, today, every time somebody else moves into the area, the conditions become worse.  I think that perhaps the proper authorities are not thoroughly screening the people.  As for Pittsburgh as a whole, I don't think that the moral conditions are worsening.\"",
