He was in Pittsburgh Monday.  Other stops include Detroit, South Bend, St. Louis, Tulsa and Los Angeles.  Louis A. Radelat, director of the commission, accompanied Jackie. Our Hero - Youngsters at IKS, above and below, listened with rapt attention as Jackie outlined the bright future which awaits those who are prepared.  He summed up the post-war change in attitude by citing that in 1946, the Jacksonville, Fla. ballpark was padlocked to prevent Jackie's playing; last year the most valuable player in Florida State League was a Negro member of the same Jacksonville club.\"",
