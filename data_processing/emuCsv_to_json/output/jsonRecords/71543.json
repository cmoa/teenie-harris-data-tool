	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Frank Kendraia, student, Murrysville and Mr. Tony Garger, salesman, Brentwood, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, October 7, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Red China should be admitted to the United Nations?\"  Mr. Kendraia's answer reads: \"I think so, but I can't say why...Perhaps it would eliminate a lot of confusion concerning what's going on in Red China.\"  Mr. Garger's answer reads: \"Red China shouldn't be admitted to the United Nations because of its method of operation and especially the way the regime steamrolled its way into political control.  The people there have no representation and no voice in their government...I don't know whether or not the Nationalists' government is a democracy, but it won't do the UN any good to admit Red China.  I don't think they would fight for anybody's individual freedom - for instance, freedom in Africa.  Nor do I think they would stand up for persons like the Hungarian freedom fighters and others who are battling for freedom.\"",
