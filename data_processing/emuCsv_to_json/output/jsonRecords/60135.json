A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\"  Answer reads: \"I believe that young single women would make the better teachers.  This would open up more jobs for this class.  In my opinion, a married woman should not have to work because she has her husband to support her.  Frankly, I can't say why, but I prefer ladies over men to teach elementary grades.\"",
