A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  From what I hear, we seem to consider African as not a part of the universe.  I don't think that we are receiving enough information about Africa or enough to understand the people and be more interested in them.\"",
