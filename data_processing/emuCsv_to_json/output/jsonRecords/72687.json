James Anderson, Canonsburg and Mr. William Mosley, enamel plant employee, Canonsburg, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, May 26, 1962, pg. 8 with question: \"Should better medical care be provided for the aged through Social Security?\" Rev. James Anderson's answer reads: \"I believe there should be because the older persons will have better security, there are a lot of elderly persons worrying about how they will be taken care of medically.  In a way, this is more important than life insurance.\"  Mr. William Mosley's answer reads: \"I think so because for one thing, the older persons don't have any other way to secure medical care- it's the only thing they can depend on.\"",
