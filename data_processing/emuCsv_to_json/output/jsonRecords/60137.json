	"CatDescriptText": "Vestula Youngblood, housewife, 7429 Upland Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 23, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike?  Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" Answer reads: \"I think that there is going to be a strike, although I hope that it doesn't happen.  You never do get caught up, and the prices of steel, gas and telephone, and other services go up.  I think that if we kept the cost of living down and at the same time worked steadily that the steelmill worker would be satisfied.\"",
