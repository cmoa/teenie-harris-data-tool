Kennedy?\"  Mrs. Parker's answer reads: \"I'm not for Kennedy.  I'm afraid that we will not have freedom of worship - that there will be some kind of a dictatorship.\"  Mr. Anderson's answer reads: \"I like the platform very much, and don't think that the fact that he is a Catholic will stop him from winning.  His least appeal is the fact that he has Lyndon Johnson as his running mate.\"",
