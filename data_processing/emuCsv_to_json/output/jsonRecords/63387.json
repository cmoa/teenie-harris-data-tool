	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Theodore Patillo, nursing service attendant at the Veterans Administration Hospital, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 28, 1959, pg. 1 with question: \"Do you think that education standards should be the same throughout the city school system or should they be lowered in order to accommodate the slower-learning pupils, particularly those who suffer the handicaps of poor home or neighborhood environments?\" answer reads: \"It is my opinion that the standards should not be lowered. Once you lower the standards, you are encouraging the slow learner to continue to be a slow learner and to have little or no incentive.  A good idea would be to have some special classes and in this way bring the slow learners up to the standard of the other pupils.\"",
