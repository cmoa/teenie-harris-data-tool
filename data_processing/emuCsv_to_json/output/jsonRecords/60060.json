A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"I think that married women in nine out of 10 cases are the better teachers.  A married woman with children understands the kids better.  I kind of think that perhaps that men should not teach elementary grades because under their supervision, the children seemingly do not get as much fun out of playing games and other recreation which is a part of school.\"",
