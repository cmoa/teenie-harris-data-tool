	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Howard B. McCune, police officer, Homewood and Mr. Madison Coleman, barber, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 23, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe there is such a \"social\" classification as \"Negro society?\"  If so, on what do you believe it is based? Do you think such a basis is valid?\" Mr. McCune's answer reads: \"...There is within the Negro race such a thing as Negro society and in my opinion it's based on education more than anything else.  And that's a good basis.\"  Mr. Coleman's answer reads: \"It's hard to say.  Every group has a society...Evidently, we have to have one...It's based mostly on money and it's not good for it to be based on this.  It should be based on qualifications, whether or not a person has done anything to help the race advance.\"",
