For years, Smoky City residents had complained of shortcomings in transportation system of cabs, with only the Yellow Cab firm having a franchise to operate.

Pittsburghers, white and colored, hailed the new cabs and their natty drivers, and the first day's business was a sell-out for President Knox and his all-colored firm. The Courier cameraman followed the Owls through on the first day, and here is their panorama: Left: Nat (King) Cole becomes the first Owl passenger, as he boards a cab in the Hill District... - Courier Photos by Moss and Harris\"",
