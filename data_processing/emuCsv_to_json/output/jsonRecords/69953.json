	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. O.E. Thompson, insurance salesman, Mt. Lebanon and Mr. Michael Dupay, insurance salesman, Monongahela, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 25, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be held responsible, to the extent of being arrested, and fined, or imprisoned, (like the responsibility for their children's attendance at school) for the delinquency practices of their respective teen-age children?\" Mr. O.E. Thompson's answer reads: \"I believe that it depends on whether or not the delinquency was committed during the day or at night.  The parents are very definitely responsible for the children if the delinquency came after hours.  I think that if the kids are out, the parents should be punished, together with the children.\"  Mr. Michael Dupay's answer reads: \"I believe, definitely, that the parents should be held responsible.  After all, the parents are supposed to rear their children so they will be responsible citizens.  I think of t he kids who went into the Mellon Bank on Sunday, during a time they should have been in church getting the proper religious guidance that is necessary in our society.  It is the duty of parents to rear their children in such a way that the children can function in society as responsible citizen.\"",
