Miss Margaret Gnade, the supervisor, is pictured above.\"  Larger cutline reads: \"Editor's note: Besides the industrial program the Pennsylvania Association for the Blind, located at 208 S. Craig Street, has a welfare program which helps to rehabilitate and to restore self-confidence for the blind.  This program is directed by Miss Marcella Goldberg and is an integral part in accomplishment of the aims of the association which is to keep blind persons from becoming social liabilities and to teach them that they can earn a decent respectful living and accept a responsible position in society.  Harold L. Bleakley, the director of the association, says that the problems which the blind person faces are numerous.  Mrs. Bleakley point out that organization, by the use of special innovations and aids, tries to alleviated the plight of the blind worker.  In doing this, however, the organization's director, who has been blind since birth, asserts that there are certain limitation which just cannot be overcome.  'We explain there limitation to the person and when he accepts them, his is well on his way to personal adjustment.'  Mr. Bleakley says, 'The blind person also realizes his is a minority group,  for that reason, I have found that at the plant there is no discrimination, even though the persons know that his boss or the worker beside him is of a different race,' Mr. Bleakley points out.\"",
