A new racial flare-up between whites and a Negro youth was sparked on the North Side this week as Ronald Carlew, 15, 1009 Western Ave., was recovering from a broken jaw and possible rupture and internal injuries after a group of five white boys, ranging from 16 to 20 years old, and a white girl, 15, knocked him down and brutally kicked him with their feet.  The youngster told reporters that the beating and kicking, in same neighborhood in which a group of teen-agers kicked an elderly white man to death two years ago, occurred as young Carlew was returning from the Arcade Theatre on East Ohio St., near Avery St.  The white gang leader came up to him and said, 'Don't you think you're out of your district.'  Then he was asked whether he had a knife?  When Carlew replied that he hadn't one, one of the bigger boys turned around and hit him, knocking him to the ground.  Then he fell back and the circle closed around Carlew with the boys and girls kicking him in the face and body.  Carlew was detained at Allegheny General Hospital from 3 to 12 P. M., Sunday.  He told police he knew two of the boys.  He has seen them on that corner before.  He could not describe the others.  He said one was about 16 years old, five foot, seven inches tall and wore a blue jacket and jeans.  The other was age 16, five foot, four inches tall, and weighed about 100 pounds, wearing a green jacket and jeans.\"",
