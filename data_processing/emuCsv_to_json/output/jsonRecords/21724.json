	"CatDescriptText": "Wesley C. Glover, 2427 Bedford Avenue, Republican, Fifth Ward was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 14, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Who is your Ward Chairman? Does he have any power? Does he exert his power?\" Answer reads: \"Dave Thompkins is my ward chairman.  As to whether or not he has any power, I say frankly that he does not.  The main reason is because of the limited number of Republicans in this ward.  And what power Mr. Tompkins does have, he exerts it only sparingly.  Any member of the party who speaks out as an individual, is bypassed by the ward chairman.  He seems as though he doesn't want to be bothered with such a person.  Before elections, he invites only a select few to his meeting.  It seems as though he doesn't want anyone whom he can't turn around his finger.\"",
