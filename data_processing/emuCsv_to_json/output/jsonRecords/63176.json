A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: I don't see why they should oppose such a tax increase. If they want better schools for their children, they have to realize that it will cost money.  However, I think that they, the average person, would oppose a tax increase.\"",
