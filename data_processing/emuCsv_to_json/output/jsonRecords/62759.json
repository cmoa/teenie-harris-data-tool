Moore Sr., retired Wylie Avenue barber, 3143 Ewart Drive, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 6, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that too much leniency is shown teenagers who commit crimes?\" answer reads: \"I certainly do. I think that the greatest trouble today is that the mothers and fathers have no control over their children, regardless of whatever they do.  Yes, the greatest trouble today today is that parents show too much leniency.  And the courts let the children who commit crimes off too easy, also.  The youth perpetrate the crimes and know that they are going to get away  with it.  The law is the law and therefore leniency should be ruled out.\"",
