A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should immediately enforce the Supreme Court's recent decision in 'Little Rock School Case' or permit the recalcitrant states to take their time in obeying?\" answer reads: \"I think that they should step in and so something about it immediately. There is nobody superior to me or anybody else.  This whole thing is disgusting. And there are a lot of colored people better than many whites.  It's a terrible thing that we treat the Negro the way that we do, I'm old and retired now, but I still don't like it.\"",
