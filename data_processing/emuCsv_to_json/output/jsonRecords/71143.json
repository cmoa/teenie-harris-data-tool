	"CatDescriptText": "Darrell Simmons, mailing clerk, Homewood and Mrs. Joseph Carr, housewife, Burgettstown, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, August 27, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"What are the most appealing nad the least appealing aspects of Republican presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon?\"  Mr. Simmons' answer reads: \"I haven't really dug into the facts about Nixon, but at present, his most appealing aspect is the staunch stand he took against Khrushchev.\" Mrs. Carr's answer reads: \"The least appealing aspect of Nixon is the fact that Kennedy appeals to me more.  I don't know why, but that's the way it is.  And also I don't like the fact that Nixon has sent his kids to an all-white school while her, at the same time is talking integration.  One of the most appealing aspects is his travelling experience.\"",
