A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"It depends upon the individual and this varies.  In some cases, the single woman makes the better teacher, while in others it is the married woman who is the best.
