	"CatDescriptText": "Gene Slebrch, senior, Knoxville and Toni Mueck, freshman, Mt. Oliver, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 12, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think students in the South are using the right technique in protesting segregation in places of public accommodations?\" Gene Slebrch's answer reads: \"I suppose the mass demonstrations are a means to an end.  However, I don't think that they are the best.  Mob rule incites drastic action and, in the riots, the only ones hurt are the ones who started it.  What is the student accomplishing then?  Nothing.  After such action which will bring out the state militia and in which the students will be overrun, they will be back where they started, and with more bitterness.\"  Toni Mueck's answer reads: \"I guess they believed that the other methods didn't work, therefore it was the only thing left to do.  They have been turned down on civil rights bills in the capital on several occasions, even though the Constitution guarantees equal rights.  If they cannot secure them in other ways, then this is good, provided mass revolt and bloodshed are prevented.\"",
