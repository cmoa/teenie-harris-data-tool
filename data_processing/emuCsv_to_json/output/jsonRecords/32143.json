Thurman of 7504 Upland St. is alive after the road \"disappeared\" under him at the top of the Morgan St. hill (arrow) last Thursday shortly before 8 P.M. Actually, the road did not disappear, because the section of what formerly was a thoroughfare had been removed by the Graziano Construction Co., in execution of a building contract with the University of Pittsburgh.  And where Morgan St. left the Carillo St. intersection and leveled off for a short plateau-like passage to Allequippa St., there were no barriers to warn motorists that the street was no longer there, police said...-Harris Photos\"",
