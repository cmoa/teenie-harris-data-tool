'She Refused on Her Own'  At the hearing, Mr. Hatzidais repeated in testimony what Alderman Fitzgerald said Hatzidais had told him in a telephone conversation several days before the trial: 'I serve everybody in my restaurant and always have.  If she refused these men service, she did it on her own initiative and I don't have any sympathy for her.  She'll take her own consequences, I make my own roles as to policy in my restaurant and discrimination has never been one of my regulations.  Miss Smith had that she had only worked ten weeks at the restaurant, that she had been employed before that by Dempsey and Rand's restaurant, Sheridan Avenue, East Liberty, and that there she was not permitted to serve Negroes upon threat of loss of her job.  She said she had been a waitress for twelve years and had found a similar policy on other jobs.  Alderman Fitzgerald asked the youths if they were willing to withdraw the case upon payment of the costs by Hatzidais and Miss Smith, which was done.  Alderman Fitzgerald said that he had received several telephone calls from Homestead business men about...[illegible] Arthur Harris, 2[?]31 Centre Avenue, and Major Ponder, 1814 Enoch Street, brought the suit.\"",
