A1 with question \"What are the most appealing nad the least appealing aspects of Republican presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon?\"  Mrs. Proctor's answer reads: \"He's a Republican, and Republicans are not for the poor class.  This is against him.  One good thing which he has is the desire to pass a Civil Rights Bill which I think he would do.\"  Mr. Moore's answer reads: \"His least appealing aspect is the fact that he's a Republican.  I don't think the Republican party is going to do much for the working class.  He's Vice President of the country and that's the most appealing aspect.\"",
