	"CatDescriptText": "James Anderson, 505 Dornestic Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 27, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think there is any racial tension in Pittsburgh? in neighborhood where you live?  If so, what do you think causes it?\" answer reads: \"The tension is not outwardly tension, but more secretive because this is the North.  It definitely exists here.  I might say that whenever a person like Faubus, who is supposed to represent the people, proclaims that he will stand behind racial tension, he's taking the stand of the old South.  I would say that the tensions which the Negro feels here in Pittsburgh, are in three groups.  They are: (1) employment; (2) restrictions from moving into certain neighborhoods, and (3) socializing.  The white person feels the tension inwardly, but can't express himself.  He doesn't know himself the reasons for tensions and when you ask him he can't give one reason.  It's just born in them. If the parents leave the kids alone, they will get along in Little Rock as well as here.\"",
