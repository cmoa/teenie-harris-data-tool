Nolan, retired, Penn Hills and Arlene Palmore, bridal shop employe, Fifth Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, October 8, 1960, pg. 33 with question: \"In your opinion, which political party, Republican or Democratic, has the best record of keeping its campaign pledges to the people of the United States?  Which party do you think would be most successful in carrying out its 1960 campaign platform-this being a Presidential election year?\"  Mr. Nolan's answer reads: \"President Eisenhower is the best we've had, and also was the first to come out for  the colored people.  President Eisenhower and his Administration have done the most in keeping campaign pledges.  And I believe Nixon has the experience and best qualifications for any job.  The Republicans, in my opinion, would better keep their campaign platform.\"  Mrs. Palmore's answer reads: \"I'm strictly a Democrat, so you know my thoughts.  The Democrats are for the poor man and the Republicans are strictly a rich man's party.\"",
