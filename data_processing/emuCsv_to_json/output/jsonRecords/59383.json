The two lone houses (right photo) have front entrances on the dirt alley, which was named in 1910, while other residences face nicely-kept Julius St. 'Rastus Way' has no place in a city which brags about its 'New Look' and general renaissance program.  The name should be changed. Don't you think? - Harris Photos.\"",
