	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Clarence Clemmons, analytical chemist, Cincinnati and Mr. Donald R. McPherson, insurance salesman, Brighton Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 4, 1961, pg. 7 with question \"Who do you think is largely responsible for Negro topflight entertainers being denied the chance to headline the Grade A television shows--the sponsors, the advertising agencies, or the general public?\" Mr. Clemmons' answer reads:\"You can't say that it hasn't been done--that Negro entertainers have not headlined topflight shows.  Perhaps the question should be worded as to why the shows don't continue.  I think the reason is the lack of public sentiment and support.  And there is a possibility that the Negro himself did not support and acclaim the shows, like giving the sponsors a pat on the back.  I think that the blame was not the Negro's alone, but the public in general which did not support the shows.\"  Mr. McPherson's answer reads: \"I say that more or less to blame are the networks.  They seem to control what goes out on the network.  However, I really don't know.  I do know that there have not been as many of these shows recently as there have been in the past.  Two or three years ago, there were quite a number of these shows...I don't know why this is not so today.  Perhaps I'm not watching the right network...\"",
