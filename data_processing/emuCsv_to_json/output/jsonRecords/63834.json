	"CatDescriptText": "Michael Lewandowski, cab driver, 313 Linton Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 15, 1959, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"No. Well, when a man commits first-degree murder, he shoul  [sic] pay, and if he took a life, his life should be taken, because the other person wanted to live just as well as he.  I don't know how society benefits from the execution of a first-degree murderer, but, however, if he kills in such a thing as armed robbery, they should kill him.  He should never be given a break, in a life sentence, because he might go out and do the same thing again and another poor, innocent person will die.\"",
