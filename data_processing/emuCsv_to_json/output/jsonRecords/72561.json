The scene was McKinley Park in Beltzhoover area.  According to Wilhelmina, the busy hands of the parents of the Cub and Boy Scouts' units of that area, under the supervision of Laura and Bryant Salters, were the real heroes and heroines of the occasion.  They did the work, said Wilhelmina.  Pepsi and I only provided the provisions and passed out the prizes.  Wilhelmina complimented, also, the manner in which Mr. Jack Cogburn and the Bedford Civic Club, of which Mrs. Bertha Petite is president, successfully handled the preparation and multitude of youngsters who gathered in the Bedford and Francis St. area early on Easter Monday afternoon for the second Pepsi-Cola sponsored egg hunt.  Later in the afternoon, Wilhelmina joined the Rev. and Mrs. Roberts at the First Baptist Church of Penn Hills, where the pretty little bunnies eagerly awaited the words 'On the mark, get set and go.'  Mrs. Roberts was ably assisted by teachers from the Sunday church school and the youngsters' parents who, together, did a marvelous job in assuring the youngsters having a good time.  Needless to say, good time was had by all.\"",
