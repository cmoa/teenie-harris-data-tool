Lawrence, right, is smiling in delight after submitting to the slate-makers' draft last Monday and becoming a candidate for Governor - a decision which restores some semblance of harmony in Democratic ranks.

But the smiling picture of the Mayor was photographed during last year's campaign, while the other picture carried 'best wishes' of Magistrate Williams after the Mayor had been sworn in early this year to begin his unprecedented fourth term as the city's chief executive. - Harris Photo.\"Cutline for image published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 11, 1964, pg. 3, reads: \"WITH DAVE LAWRENCE - Pittsburgh political leader Dave Lawrence, whom \"Pappy\" aided greatly in becoming Mayor of Pittsburgh and later Governor of Pennsylvania is shown congratulating Mr. Williams whom Lawrence appointed a police magistrate in 1946. - Harris Photo.\"David L.
