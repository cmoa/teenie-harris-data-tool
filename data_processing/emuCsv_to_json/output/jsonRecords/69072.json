A1  with question: \"Do you think ethnic groups (like the Negro people) profit more by voting a straight party ticket, or are there better advantages for them in splitting a ticket?\"  Mrs. Nancy McCormick's answer reads: \"I think the straight party vote and for the Democratic party, because it does more than any other party.\"  Mr. John Collins' answer reads: \"I figure the best is the straight vote.  One reason is that you get more than if you split the vote.  By a straight party vote, you have more to fight with.\"",
