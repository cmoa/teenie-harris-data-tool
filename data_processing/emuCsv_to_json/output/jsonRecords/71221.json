	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. William (Bill) Kemmler, salesman, Canonsburg and Rev. Charles Pace Jr., 2310 Centre Avenue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 15, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"In dispensing political patronage jobs to various groups, what should be  the determining factor- the financial contribution of that group to the party, or the number of votes the group casts for the party?\" Mr. William (Bill) Kemmler's answer reads: I don't think either... I think the basis should be merit, that is, whether or not the person can do the job...if he or she can't do the job, there's no good in having them there.\"Rev. Charles Pace Jr.'s answer reads: \"The jobs should go to those who support the party and who stand and fight for the party to show that the party is the thing needed for honest government.  This should be the foremost consideration, because money can't buy everything.  But the support of the people can win a war and also is the deciding factor on what tomorrow and the future will be.\"",
