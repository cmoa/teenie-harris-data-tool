A1 with question: \"Do you think that business and employment are as good as the Eisenhower administration declares that it is?\" answer reads: \"As far as the Eisenhower administration and the economic system is concerned, I say that it is terrible, and it seems to me that it's because of the simple reason that the Eisenhower administration's not ...the interest of the people the way it should have been doing. I don't think that the recession should be as bad as it was.  It seems to me as though the Eisenhower administration didn't try to prevent it.
