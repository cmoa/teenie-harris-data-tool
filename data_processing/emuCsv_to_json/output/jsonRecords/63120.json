Herbert, district executive of the Boy Scouts, 312 Stanwix Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 7, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the Wacs and others women's units, with the exception of nurses, should be abolished in armed services during peacetime? Why?\" answer reads: \"I think, definitely, that there is a place for the women, children and adults of America to get training for our nation's defense.  If it is necessary for the preparedness of our country to have the women service units, I think that we should keep them.  But I would like to stress that the family is the primary source from which we draw our preparedness and should not be neglected.\"",
