Dr. Bolden of Pittsburgh, second from left, who has entertained the Braves in his home several times, also sent a word of cheer.  Aaron suffered the accident while sliding into third bas with a triple, which was his fourth hit in game against the Reds.  He is out for the rest of the season, but will be transferred to Milwaukee from Cincinnati as soon as the injury is sufficiently healed.  Aaron has been one of the sparkplugs all season in the Milwaukee drive for the pennant, playing sensational ball in left field, and hitting close to .300 all season.  Despite the injury, Aaron will very likely be considered for 'Rookie of the Year' honors.\"",
