	"CatDescriptText": "Howard Stubblefield, postal employee, Homewood and Ann Foster, postal employee, Uptown, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, August 19, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"what action, if any, should be taken and by whom, when Negro members of integrated teams refuse to play before segregated crowds?\"  Mr. Stubblefield's answer reads: \"If any action is taken, it should be against the sponsors of the game.  The managers and owners know they can't force the men to play, and they know it would be pretty hard to put the game on without them.\"  Mrs. Foster's answer reads: \"The owners and managers of the team should backup the players, but it's up to the players themselves to take the stand.  The owners should have the responsibility of following through on it, but you must fight your battles for yourself, because nobody else is going to do it for you.\"",
