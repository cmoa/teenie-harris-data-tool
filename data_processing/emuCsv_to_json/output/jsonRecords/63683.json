	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. James Orr, unemployed, 402 Kirkpatrick Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 11, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you believe churches of any denomination receive appreciation financial help from racketeers?\" Answer reads: \"I think that those who do receive money receive just a small amount.  I'm not a member of any church, but my faith is in Living God.  My belief leads me to say that I think that any money coming from the racketeers is bad money and the church is not carrying out the plan of God and also it is receiving money which was made by breaking man made laws.  And if the racketeers had been caught in making this money, they would go to jail.\"",
