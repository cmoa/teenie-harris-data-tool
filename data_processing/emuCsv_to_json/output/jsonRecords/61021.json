Handley, 7226 Travella Blvd. and Mr. Anderson Little, 806 Whiteside Road, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 4, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you believe that Negro communities actually choose their leaders or do they accept the leadership, which 'the powers-that-be' select and 'hand' to them?\" Mrs. Marion P. Handley's answer reads: \"I believe that they accept the leadership given to them. There are a few persons in community who do not.  They are the civic-minded persons.\"  Mr. Anderson Little's answer reads: \"I think they accept what is handed to them.  They don't take enough interest in learning about their leaders.  If they would take more interest in learning about leaders, it would give everybody a better community in which to live, to have friends, and to be a part of.  I ask 'Why don't we try it the next time we have an important election?'\"",
