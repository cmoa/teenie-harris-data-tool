	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Bob Stiefvater, hotel worker, Baldwin and Miss Rose Marie Woods, high school student, East Liberty, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 29, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that laws should be made and enforced to eliminate segregation and discrimination, or should education and \"moral persuasion\" be used instead?\"  Mr. Steifvater's answer reads: \"I believe that it starts at home.  For instance, when I was a youngster, my parents taught me that it didn't make any difference who you were, because we're no better than each other.  As a result, I've played with Chinese, and was the only white neighbor on a Negro team.\"  Ms. Woods' answer reads: \"I think education, because the laws so easily are broken.\"",
