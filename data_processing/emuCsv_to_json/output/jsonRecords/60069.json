	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Clarence Grey, steel worker, 404 Covel Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 16, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think that America is as friendly towards Africa as she should be.  Most other countries are receiving foreign aid from the United States, but Africa gets very little, with the exception of that of private industries, America, as a nation, is contributing very little to the country.  And I don't think that we are receiving sufficient knowledge about this country.  I believe that we have a tendency to look down our noses at Africans.  This is not right.\"",
