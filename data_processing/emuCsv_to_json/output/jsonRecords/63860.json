B1 with question: \"Do you believe the John James Racket Squad is driving the numbers racket out of Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"They are not driving them clean out, but into hiding places. The numbers operators are not as much in the open as they had been.  It is harder for them to operate.  I think there should be a law to make it legal to play the numbers just the same as horse betting is legal in some states.  That way there will be more tax income and in some way the burden will be taken off the working man.\"",
