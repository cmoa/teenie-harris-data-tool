	"CatDescriptText": "Joseph Zord, department store clerk, Whitehall and Thomas Grogan, laborer, Liberty Avenue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 3, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that integration in all schools in the South should be effected immediately, or do you favor permitting a reasonable length of time?  If so, how long a period do you consider as a \"reasonable length of time?\"  Mr. Zord's answer reads: \"A reasonable amount of time should be allowed to integrate...It's something that can't be rushed into...I would like to see integration tomorrow, but I don't think this can be done...I think a beginning for all schools should be next year.  This should be accomplished by integrating one grade at a time...\"  Mr. Grogan's answer reads: \"The South should be given time to integrate.  If you try to force Southerners to integrate, no good will come out of this.  A reasonable time would be a couple of years.\"",
