A7, reads: \"CELEBRATING GRAND OPENING - The Hotel Gold Coast, located at 229 State Street in Clairton, is celebrating the grand opening of the much-talked about \"Mystery Room\" and the upstairs diner. Patrons are being entertained in beautiful outer bar with music furnished by the Castinelli Trio. Downstairs in the newly opened \"Mystery Room,\" now called the \"Cave,\" music is being furnished by the Jewels, a well-known group in the Tri-State Area.  Their new recordings are soon to be released.  The Gold Coast is managed by Charlie Robinson of Clairton.  On Tuesday, Sept. 7, a cabaret party will be held in the \"Cave.\"  A star-studded floor show will be on hand for the top in entertainment.  Reservations can be made by calling Clairton 3-9837.  Come out and visit the Gold Coast ... see the \"Cave\" that is authentic in every detail. There's nothing like it in the Tri-State Area.  All this week, Cathy Maddox, Holly Graham and Jack Bowers, all of WMCK in McKeesport, are appearing at the Gold Coast. - Harris Photo.\"",
