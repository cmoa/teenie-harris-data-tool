Truman visited the Hill District Wednesday night and made his \"whistle-stop\" address in the square adjacent to Centre Avenue Police Station, thousands of persons waited to listen to him.  Several thousand others lined the streets to catch a glimpse of him along his route to Syria Mosque where he made a nation-wide television and radio broadcast.  One of the curious things that occurred happened when two of the spectators unfurled the banner, \"We Like Ike\" shown above.  The crowd at Centre Avenue Police Station was estimated by police at 10,000 persons. - Harris Photo\"",
