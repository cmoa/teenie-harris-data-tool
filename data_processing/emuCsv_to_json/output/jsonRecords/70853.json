Does it carry 'weight' among Negroes or white people or both?  Why?\" answer reads: \"Definitely among Negroes, and I think the same effect among whites, especially those not so bigoted.  Any person who is broadminded [sic] does not care about the race of a leader.  If a leader has a job and does it right, then they will follow him.\"",
