In addition, she will profit from having been in crowd leaving the church which was snapped by Courier Photographer Charles (Teenie) Harris.  There is a $5 award awaiting the person whose picture is ringed in a crowd photo taken some place in Western Pennsylvania each week.  It may be at a church or it may be at some other gathering.  Wherever the crowd is, The Courier photographers and reporters are usually there.  Last week's winner was Walter Lucas of 40-E Midway Drive, Whitaker.\"",
