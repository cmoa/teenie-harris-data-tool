	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Sandra Allen, business school student, 1224 Vinemont St., was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 16, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"I think that they could be a little friendlier.  We need all the countries we can on our side, it doesn't hurt to help anyone because in aiding the undeveloped countries we are helping ourselves in end.  As to whether or not we are receiving sufficient information about Africa, I would say that it would not hurt to send somebody over there to find out and report more information about the country.  America is not looking down her nose at Africans and other undeveloped countries because we are always trying to help them.\"",
