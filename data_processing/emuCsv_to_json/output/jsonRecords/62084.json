A2, with question: \"Do you think that Negroes display any racial prejudice towards each other?\"  Answer reads: \"In a way, I guess that we do display prejudices against each other. It's shown in the way some talk.  And this is further shown in the way the kids talk on the street when they call each other bad racial names which they probably heard in their homes as well as other sources.\"",
