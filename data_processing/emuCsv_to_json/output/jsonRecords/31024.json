The little one can stand his 'ground' even when she moves about the room or climbs the stairs. - Harris Photo.\"  Accompanying article by Phyl Garland reads: \"Balances Self on Mother's Hand - Three-Month-Old Infant On His Way Up in World.  Tony Williams, three-month-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Connie Williams of 2249 Somers Dr., only has disdain for the traditional 'bouncing' babies, because he can stand unassisted and balance himself on the palm of his mother's hand, while she lifts him to heights above her head, goes up and down stairs, or even dances.  'He just loves heights, and the higher I raise him, the better,' says his mother, an attractive housewife with a knack for painting and interior decorating.  Mrs. Williams added that she began to train Tony to accomplish this feat when he was a mere two months old.'  He used to make so much fuss when I'd take my morning exercises, I thought maybe he'd like to try it too,' she continued, as she demonstrated the way she gently would manipulate his little arms and legs.  'I started him out by holding him while he stood on my knees, and we just worked up to this,' she explained.  The most amazing thing is that Mrs. Williams claims that all of her other five children were able to do the same thing at about the age of three months with her coaching.  'I didn't even think there was anything that unusual about it,' said Mrs. Williams, 'until one day when a friend of mine came in while I was dancing around with him on my hand, she started hollering for me to 'put that baby down.'  Because she thought I'd drop him.  I thought she was going to have a heart attack.'  The proud mother said further that little Tony loves to be swung around by his legs and 'exercised' about twice a day.  'He doesn't like to be treated like a baby,' she pointed out as Tony gurgled his own contentment.  Both Mrs. Williams and her husband, an unemployed steelworker, are sports enthusiasts.  All the children have been trained to enjoy keeping their bodies fit.  The older boys spend much of their time at a nearby gym.  Mr. Williams is casual about the whole thing and commented calmly: 'Women and their children!  What they won't do!'\"",
