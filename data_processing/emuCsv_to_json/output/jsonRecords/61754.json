	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Robert Jackson, 502 Kirkpatrick Street, retired, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 15, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think common-law marriage should be outlawed?\" answer reads: \"I believe in God and therefore I don't think that anyone is married until the marriage is by God for the sake of his fellowman [sic], which means going and getting a marriage license. For any man to live with a woman for six months and call her his wife is not good.  In fact, it is a sin in the sight of God.  And something has to happen to such a situation.  In my opinion, this is the reason why a lot of women are doing the men bad today.\"",
