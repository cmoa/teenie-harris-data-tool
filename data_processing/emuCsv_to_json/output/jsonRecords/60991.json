	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Hazel Harrison, 1005 Rivermont Drive, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 21, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Do you think that the proposed six-day-a-week school attendance, as proposed by Governor Leader, is the answer to the Russian challenge in scientific education?\" answer reads: \"Really and truly, I for one mother would be bitterly against it. I prefer a one and one-half hour addition to the school day or the continuation of the school term into July rather than a straight six day week.  As it is, a lot of students make use of the two day weekend, and they need Saturdays for themselves.\"",
