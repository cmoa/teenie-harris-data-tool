Thomas, 2508 Wylie Avenue, Fifth Ward, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 26, 1957, pg. 4, with question: \"Do you believe we should have a state law forbidding strikes of trolley cars, buses, and taxicabs?\" answer reads: \"Yes, and definitely towards the trolley business. I pay taxes of which the street car company benefits and here I am walking to work or spending a lot of money for taxicabs and other means of transportation.  This is money which I just can't afford.  Since the street car strike, I've been paying about $3 a day for transportation.\"",
