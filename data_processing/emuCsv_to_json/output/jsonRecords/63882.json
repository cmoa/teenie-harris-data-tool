A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"No, I believe that after 1 A.M. you are starting the Sabbath and this day should be started right.
