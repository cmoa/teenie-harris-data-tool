A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should be 'militant' in their fight for civil rights or pursue a course of 'sitting down, talking and seeking a working plan for obtaining them without vigorous pressure?\"  Answer reads: \"I think that the NAACP, through its militant stand has done pretty well.
