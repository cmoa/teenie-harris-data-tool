A1 with question: \"In the coming November elections, do you think voters should elect another Democratic Governor or change to a Republican?\" William Dunbar's answer reads: \"They should elect another Democratic Governor. The reason is that I think that Negroes have gained more in city and state governments under the Democrats than the Republicans.\"  Elliott Matthews' answer reads: \"I think they should stay with the Democrats.  The reason is that I've never gone hungry under the Democrats, but I have under the Republicans.\"",
