Mr. Watson was one of those who pleaded that continued rent controls are needed to prevent the gouging of those who cannot afford deluxe apartments.  The Pittsburgh Real Estate Board led the opposition to further controls, contending that there is no shortage of housing.  Their representatives failed to establish that the vacancies cited were within the price range below $70 per month.  Council is expected to pass the...tion early next week. - Harris Photo.\"",
