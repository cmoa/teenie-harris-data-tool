A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should be 'militant' in their fight for civil rights or pursue a course of 'sitting down, talking and seeking a working plan for obtaining them without vigorous pressure?\"Answer reads: \"I think that the drive for equal rights should be on a conciliatory basis.  I think that if you try to force a person to do anything you will not succeed.  However, if you try to compromise, the other party will try to meet you half way, and in some cases better than half way.\"",
