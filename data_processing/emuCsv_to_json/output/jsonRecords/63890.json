A1 with question: \"Do you think children should be given 'allowances' (money)? If so, for what reason or reasons (just to have spending money or for chores done around the house, etc.)?  Do you think that it helps or hinders the development of the youngster?\" answer reads: \"Yes, it should be given, up to a certain age.  I would say until around 15 or 16.  At that time if the youth is of his right mind, he should be able to have a job and partially carry himself along.\"",
