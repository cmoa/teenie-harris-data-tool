Well, that's just what one well-known Pittsburgher has going for him... The talented Clifford Morrison, of 850 Delmont Avenue, Beltzhoover, who is possessed with a great amount of creative ability...  Variable Drill Press - (Upper right) The Beltzhoover wizard of the calipers and lathe is shown operating a 15-inch, multiple, variable drill press in his basement workshop.  It too, is used quite a bit in precision machining by 'Cliff.'  Its utility value is great.  Among his tools is the rare and valuable cobalt-tungsten-carbide cutting bit, which Morrison has been given the privilege of possessing and using.  It cuts the hardest of steel.  Permission of own and use such a bit is given by such agencies as the FBI, he says, otherwise the bits might fall into wrong hands... - Harris Photos.\"",
