A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that children of the elementary grades should work after school. However, for those kids of secondary school, I think that it is alright to have such jobs like delivering papers.  Even with a light job, I don't think that the kids should work too hard or for too many hours, because it will be detrimental to the health of the children.  A school child needs all the energy which he can muster up and especially today when such diseases like polio and other things are going around.\"",
