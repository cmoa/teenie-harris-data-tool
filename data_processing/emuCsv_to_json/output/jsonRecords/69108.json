Lowmiller, truck driver, Dormont and Miss Carol Vanets, bookkeeper, Bulger, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, June 17, 1961, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you think that courses in race relations should be taught in the public schools?  If so, in what grade do you think they should be taught first?\" Mr. George F. Lowmiller's answer reads: \"It [sic] think the courses should be taught and they should begin around the fourth or fifth grades, because children at that age understand better.\"  Miss Carol Vanets' answer reads: \"I think from kindergarten and throughout school there should be such courses, because race relations are just as important as other subjects which are being taught at that age.\"",
