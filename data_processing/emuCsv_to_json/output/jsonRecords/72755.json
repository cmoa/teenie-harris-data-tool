	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Jeannette Key, advanced sophomore, Cheyney State College and Mr. Arch McClanahan, retired worker, Webster Avenue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 28, 1962, pg. 11 with question: \"As a newspaper reader, what type of stories have the greatest appeal to you; In other words, which stories do you read first?\"  Ms. Key's answer reads: \"I think current events, things which affect me each day, are the things which affect me everyday.  For instance, the Berlin situation, and whether or not Red China will be admitted into the United Nations.  Of course, you can't conceal crime when it's large enough to make the headlines.  I read that type of news, but it is not my main interest.\"  Mr. McClanahan's answer reads: \"I usually read the editorials and then sports and then the news in general.\"",
