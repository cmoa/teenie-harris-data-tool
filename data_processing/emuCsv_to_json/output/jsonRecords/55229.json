Fitzgerald's courtroom in Pittsburgh to withdraw charged of non-support of her four-year-old daughter, brought several months ago, against John B. (Dizzy) Gillespie, nationally known band leader and idol of the 'beebop set.' Gillespie was arrested on Wednesday, June 17, after he finished playing a one-night engagement at the Walter Robinson American Legion Post in Sewickley.  Mother, the daughter, Cheryl, and Gillespie, all chatted amicably as the case was being withdrawn and everyone seemed pleased over the settlement. - Harris Photo.\"",
