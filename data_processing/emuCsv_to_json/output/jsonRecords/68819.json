Washington, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 29, 1961, pg.7 with question: \"Do you believe that Russia actually 'put a man in space'--in orbit around the earth, or do you think that it was a 'trial run' to test man and rocket, prior to an attempt to put him in actual orbit in outer space?\" Mr. Robert Peterson's answer reads: \"I think there may have been a trial run, but I don't think they put a man into space.
