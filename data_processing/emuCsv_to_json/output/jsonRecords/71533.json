Jones, porter, Roberts Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 18, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Negroes in Pittsburgh are as progressive as those in other metropolitan cities like New Your, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles? Why?\"  Mrs. Bowen's answer reads: \"I really don't think so.  It just looks like we havent' had the chance...Perhaps it will come soon, because Eisenhower is out and Kennedy is in the White House, and he is trying to do the best he can to help Negroes.\"  Mr. Jones' answer reads: \"I would say, actually, no, because here Negroes don't have the pick-up like others.\"",
