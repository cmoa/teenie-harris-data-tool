	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Walter C. Worthington, food supervisor student, 3416 Iowa Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 23, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike?  Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" answer reads: \"Due to the past ways that negotiations have been conducted between the union and industry, I might say that there is a possibility that we may have a strike.  However, I do not see where there will be a great benefit from the steelworkers receiving pay raises.  for one thing, there will be more money going into taxes and the cost of living will go so high that it will be almost impossible to live or for that matter to exist.  I think that they are justified to get the raise, but afterwards, because of the increase in standard of living, I don't think that it is justified.\"",
