	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Clifton Pugh, 1513 Wofford Way, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 15, 1958, pg. 2 �Do you think that the numbers game should be legalized or outlawed?� answer reads: �My unbiased comment is that if the numbers were legalized, it woul dmake more revenue for the city government. We might as well face the fact that there are gambling and vice throughout most of the country.  This is brought to light by the crime problems which we have had.  By legalizing thenumbers, the money coming in to help run the government most likely would lead to the cutting out of some of the taxes we are paying now.�",
