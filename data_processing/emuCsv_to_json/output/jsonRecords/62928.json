	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Vincent White, 404 Robinson Court, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 18, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should immediately enforce the Supreme Court's recent decision in 'Little Rock School Case' or permit the recalcitrant states to take their time in obeying?\" answer reads: \"Anytime the Supreme Court makes a ruling, it should be backed up by the Federal Government. What good is the law if it is not enforced.  When the Supreme Court made the ruling it should have devised ways of implementing it so the law could be put into practice.  This applies to any law.  The Supreme Court is supposed to be the supreme body so far as the interpretation of the law is concerned.  When a state can supersede the Federal laws of the nation, you might as well dispose of such things as the Federal law, the Supreme Court and the judiciary.\"",
