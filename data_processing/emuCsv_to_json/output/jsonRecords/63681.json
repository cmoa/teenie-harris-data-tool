A1 with question: \"Do you believe churches of any denomination receive appreciation financial help from racketeers?\" answer reads: \"Yes, they do.  The money comes from different winds.  And I say that since it is good, what difference does it make where it comes from as long as it is used for something good?  The church has to have the money.  I would say that it is all right as long as the church does not see the person donating the money.  I don't think that the money is good if the church knows that it comes from a bad source.\"",
