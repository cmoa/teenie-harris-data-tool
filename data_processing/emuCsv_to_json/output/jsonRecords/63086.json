A1 with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\" answer reads: �Actually, like the President says, Mr. Mikoyan should be treated hospitably. Our country is not noted for unhospitable treatment to its guests.  Most of the trouble, which Mr. Mikoyan has received, has been from Hungarian refugees who have a good right to be angry.�",
