A1 with question \"Do you think that the military strength for defense of the United States is adequate enough like Presidential candidate Richard Nixon declares it is, or do you believe that it is not strong enough, and needs strengthening, like Presidential candidate John Kennedy says it is?\"  Ms. Ashly's answer reads: \"I feel there's always room for improvement.  I go along with Kennedy.  We should re-enforce to the extent that we would be comparable to Russia.\"  Mr. McCloskey's answer reads: \"I give a loaded answer because I'm a registered Democrat and am in complete accord with Senator Kennedy's statement.  I feel we could invest more in such programs like the space missile project.\"",
