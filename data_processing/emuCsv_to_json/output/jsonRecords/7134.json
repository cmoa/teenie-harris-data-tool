He then came to Pittsburgh for a personal appearance and while here blasted the fact that there are no Negro members on almost all of the draft boards in the South and few in the North.  He also was critical of the Congress stripping Powell of his House Education and Labor Committee chairmanship and the latter's Harlem district of a representative among other things. - Harris Photo.\"",
