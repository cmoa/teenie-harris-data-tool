Walt and his boys- Jon Morris, Nate Harper, Billy Lewis, Harold Lee and Will Smith - almost blew the stars out of the sky. Walt, who is currently leading the greatest band of his career (third place in Courier band poll, one of the leading combos in the East) was immediately booked for future dances at Tech. The harper crew is currently on a one- nighter and college prom tour. Last week they finished proms at St. Michael's High School, and at St. Francis at Loretto. This week Harper is due at the Courier Band Concert in Detroit, and then will head for Chicago for a short vacation. Upon his return he will resume his disc jockey show over WHOD, and will continue on his prom tour.\"-Harris Photo",
