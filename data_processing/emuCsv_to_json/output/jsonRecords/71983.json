Grimmet, Board of Education employee, Terrace Village and Mr. Joseph Frazier, electrician, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 16, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the so-called 'store-front' churches, and those who are known generally as 'self-styled preachers,' are an asset or a liability to the community.\" Mr. Kenneth E. Grimmet's answer reads: \"Personally, I think that it's more or less an asset, because I think most are sincere and they truly believe in what they are doing.\"  Mr. Joseph Frazier's answer reads: \"I wouldn't comment too much.  It depends on where it is and, also, depends on the pastor.  And that's regardless of whether its a big church or a store front.  Perhaps if it hadn't been for small churches, there wouldn't have been so many larg [sic] churches today.  And I think of John Wesley Church which began, not in a 'store front,' but in a field.\"",
