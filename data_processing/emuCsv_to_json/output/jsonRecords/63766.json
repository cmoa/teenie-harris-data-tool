	"CatDescriptText": "James Bryant, 114 17th Street, Jeannette, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 13, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the hospital service rendered under Blue Cross plan is worth its present cost to the subscriber? Do you think the rates should be raised?  Why?\"  Answer reads: \"I've been working for about six months and I really haven't taken it under too much consideration.  However, I feel that it's good for such persons as ex-servicemen who become sick and do not have the money to pay hospital expenses.  I don't think, however, that the present rates for the insurance should be increased.  They are working on volume, therefore to increase the rates would seem like taking unfair advantage of the subscribers.\"",
