Among those trapped in an automobile, with the victim, but who managed to escape a watery grave were, left to right, Anna Mae Jamison, Mrs. Roxie Williams and Mrs. Gertrude Williams, all of 24 Fernando Street, and David Howze of 1113 Liverpool Street, driver of the car.  Marie Williams (inset), co-owner of the car, missed the fate of the others, having been discharged as a passenger at her home a short time before the ill-fated auto was truck by the flood waters as it carried the other passengers in the direction of their respective homes. - Harris Photo.\"",
