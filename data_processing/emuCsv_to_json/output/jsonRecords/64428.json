A1 with question: \"Do you think that the steel strike will be resumed after the 80-day 'cooling-off' period imposed by the Supreme Court under the injection of the Taft-Hartley Act?\" answer reads: \"I don't think so, because I feel that there will be a settlement. Also, if there is not a settlement, I believe that the workers will not go out again.  They are all poor men, and once they get in they will stay in plants.\"",
