Starting from scratch last year, I now employ three clerks and am anticipating enlarging the store at an early date and naturally will have to employ some more of our boys and girls.'  Thornton daily visits the nearby farms and produce yards to procure the fine fresh quality merchandise that he dispenses to his many customers.  'I have noticed that competition from one of our own causes the competitor to sell at a lower price, and if nothing else is gained, the customer can be assured that he will save many a penny by the appearance of a race business operating in a neighborhood.' Reading from left to right: Clifford Williams, Mrs. Selma Thornton, Earl (Blair) Palmer and Robert Thornton.\"",
