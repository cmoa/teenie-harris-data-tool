Lem Nixon's 24 markers tied the sensational McCoy's total for the evening, and Charles Robinson with 12, and Bill Peatross with 10, aided the Bulldog's cause, but it was just too much McCoy.  It was Farrell which bumped Westinghouse in western Regional PIAA Class A basketball final last year by an almost identical score of 55-54.\"",
