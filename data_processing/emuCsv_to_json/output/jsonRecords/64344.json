Hutchinson, 249 Thorn Street, Sewickley and Clifford Williams, Lake Terminal employee, 3310 Webster Avenue, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 28, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think race relations are improved, are worse, or about the same today as compared to pre-World War II years?\" Reverend Hutchinson's answer reads: \"Better.  You don't hear about race riots like we did several years ago when such happened on the North Side and in the Highland Rev. Hutchinson Park area.\"  Mr. Williams' answer reads: \"They are improved.  I say that there is a better understanding among races and there are a few more jobs.  We still have quite some distance to go, however.\"",
