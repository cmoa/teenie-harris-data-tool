	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Lewis Goodman, 3243 Arlington Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 10, 1958, pg. A2, with question: \"Do you think that Negroes display any racial prejudice towards each other?\"  Answer reads: \"Not purposely. There are conditions under which they separate themselves, but I would not call this displaying prejudice.  For instance, persons of one income group separate themselves from persons of a higher income bracket.  I would not call this discrimination.  Another instance concerns education.  Because of this educational difference, those persons who are in college or have a college education are not so much inclined to associate with fellows who are not in school or have not attended school.  This is a separation because of environment and family income, but it is purposeful segregation.\"",
