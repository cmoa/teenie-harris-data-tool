A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should immediately enforce the Supreme Court's recent decision in 'Little Rock School Case' or permit the recalcitrant states to take their time in obeying?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think that the states should be allowed to continue to evade the Supreme Court decision. Whatever steps are necessary to bring about compliance by the states should be taken immediately by the Federal Government.  Since the case for integration is more pronounced in Arkansas, if the state is allowed to evade the issue, it will set a precedence for other states with school integration cases to follow.\"",
