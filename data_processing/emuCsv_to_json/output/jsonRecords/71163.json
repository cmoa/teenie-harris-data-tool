I think most jobs should be given out on the basis of ability.  I emphasize that I definitely do not believe the dispensers of the jobs should be concerned about contributions, but instead, the merit of the person.\"  Mr. William (Bill) Kemmler's answer reads: I don't think either... I think the basis should be merit, that is, whether or not the person can do the job...if he or she can't do the job, there's no good in having them there.\"",
