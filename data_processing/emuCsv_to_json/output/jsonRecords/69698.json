A1 reads: \"Filthy 'Eyesore' - This debris-cluttered area in middle of the 2100 block of Wylie Ave., has persisted for more than a month and a half. It is not only an \"eyesore\" to residents and passersby, but it constitutes a health hazard, particularly during these hot and humid days.  Neighbors' complaints apparently have fallen on deaf ears in City Hall and in the county.  The Health Department needs to have a look and take immediate action. - Harris Photo.\"",
