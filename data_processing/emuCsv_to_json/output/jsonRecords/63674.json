A1 with question: \"Do you think those receiving Mother's Assistance should be required to report to the proper authorities just how all of the grant is spent, or should the present latitude in spending it be permitted to continue?\" answer reads: \"Personally, I think that they should be made to report because there are going to be a lot of people who will spend it in the wrong way. I think that those receiving assistance should not find it hard to say that they are spending for rent, shoes, food and what-have-you.  And they should not mind reporting how they have spent the money because it is the right thing to do.\"",
