A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"I prefer single women in nine out of ten times because this group can concentrate more on teaching elementary school...It's all right for men to teach elementary grades, but I think that the best teachers are those men who are married.\"",
