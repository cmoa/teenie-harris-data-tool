	"CatDescriptText": "Cutline of image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1941, pg. 3, reads: \"These Youths Will Lose Out When WPA Cuts Curtail Supervised Play Here - Children like those in top picture will lose their supervised play periods when the July 3rd WPA cut releases over 1500 Community Service workers including many playground and recreational experts. Adolescent girls like the volley-ball players shown at the bottom, left, will be thrown back into slum streets for recreation at the very age when health and strength contribute so much to a happy womanhood.  Scientifically supervised athletics, however, are decreed by Congress to be luxuries in this time of National Defense, even if the rising generation must play in the streets.  The picture at the right reveals the interest parents show in the clean safe and pleasant playgrounds where their smaller children are carefully guarded and supervised, secure from traffic dangers which statistics prove to be greatest in congested residential districts and where many children must somehow find an outlet.  Pittsburgh parents had hoped for an increase in supervised recreation rather than this curtailment, which they fear will further expose their youngsters to the evils and dangers of dirty, traffic-crowded streets and alleys. - Harris photo.\"",
