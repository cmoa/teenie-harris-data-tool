	"CatDescriptText": "A.R. Hall, 205 Knox Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 27, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think there is any racial tension in Pittsburgh? in neighborhood where you live?  If so, what do you think causes it?\" answer reads: \"To some extent, yes.  I don't know what they have against the colored people, but I guess that it's just because of the color of one's skin.  Of course, we have been good to the colored people in Pennsylvania, in giving them some privileges, like riding in Pullmans, attending churches and visiting restaurants, but there still is tension.  I'm an anti-segregationist myself and I can't see it any other way.\"",
