	"CatDescriptText": "Cutline of image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 6, 1958, pg. A6, reads: \"Crowds Wait to Hear 'Messiah' - This crowd jammed the sidewalk on Wylie Ave., Sunday, waiting to go inside of Central Baptist Church, pastored by the Rev. Cornell E. Talley, to hear the noon-day address of Dr. Martin Luther King (inset), famed pastor of Dexter Street Baptist Church, Montgomery, Ala., who led the effective bus boycott.  Another over-flow crowd was inside listening to the '20th Century Messiah,' who spoke at 10 A. M. also.  At both services, the young, militant speaker held the jam-packed audiences spellbound as he expounded on the subject, 'A Knock at Midnight.'  He developed the theme on sociological, psychological and moral planes, and with masterful oratory, explored the corridors and avenues of each of these planes in relation to man, his place in the world, and his duty to God.  Dr. King was most emphatic in discussing the failure of present-day churches of both races to meet the demands of tension-ridden men and women.  He urged that churches of all denominations take a stand against the 'Midnight Aura' blanketing the problem of school segregation, and that all forms of segregation be abolished.  The brilliant theologian called upon the churches to answer the 'knock of mankind in search of the bread of faith, human dignity and love.'  Dr. King's first published book, 'Strides Toward Freedom,' will be released soon.  The Courier photographer took the pictures of the crowd, up and down the street, from the Rev. Mr. Talley's upstairs study. - Harris Photo.\"",
