	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Ruby Johnson, 36 Petrosky Street, Woods Run, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"I think that the church congregation should pay its minister a cost-of-living salary. Also, they should give him a paid vacation.  Just as my husband is working and getting a paid vacation, the minister is working for us, and therefore he too should get a vacation with pay.  As for special gratuity days, the church should pay enough in salary so the minister won't need extra money.\"",
