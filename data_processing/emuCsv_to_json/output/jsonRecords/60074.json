A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"The single woman, in my opinion, will make the better teacher.  The reason--why because they don't have any responsibilities which would keep them from having their mind on their work.  I am undecided about whether or not men should teach in elementary school.\"",
