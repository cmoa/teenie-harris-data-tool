The occasion was the last of the current season of Walt Harper Jazz Workshops.  It could have been the flu or lack of money after the heavy Christmas shopping spending that held down the crowd.  But those on hand enjoyed a rare musical treat.  Miss Simone was superb.  And so was the Walt Harper Quintet which played for dancing between shows. - Harris Photo.\"",
