Does he have any power?  Does he exert it?\" Robert Cook's answer reads: \"I don't know who the ward chairman is, whether he has power and whether or not he exerts it.  I'm just interested in voting each election day.\"  Leroy Perkins' answer reads: \"I don't know who the ward boss is.  The main reason, I guess, is that I'm not interested in politics.  All i do is vote.\"",
