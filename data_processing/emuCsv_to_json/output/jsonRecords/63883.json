A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"It sounds all right to me for the taverns to remain open until 2 A.M.  As I see it, there are a lot of people who are out at that time.  And I see no reason why the taverns should not be open on Sunday.\"",
