	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Donald L. English, 2319 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 21, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Do you think that the proposed six-day-a-week school attendance, as proposed by Governor Leader, is the answer to the Russian challenge in scientific education?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think that it would have any bearing on the educational competition with Russia. The reason is that a child must have drive and initiative in order to pursue scientific studies like nuclear physics, chemistry and other related fields.  In other words, I believe that although you can send the child to school for any number of days, during the week he won't accomplish much unless he has initiative to do so.\"",
