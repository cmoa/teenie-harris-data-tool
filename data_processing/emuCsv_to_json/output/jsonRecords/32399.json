Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, 1511 Swissvale Ave., when the pastor, Rev. S. D. Bonaparte, and members of the happy congregation dedicated the recently installed pool for Baptist in church vestry. Mrs. Nancy Hunter, one of the pioneer members of the church, donned the baptismal gown and head-dress and stood in the pool with the pastor, as a symbol of the many hundreds of souls who will be converted and baptized in the Baptist faith at this particular soul-saving station.  The new church edifice, which was purchased from a Methodist congregation approximately two years ago, is still in the process of adaptation.  The $2,000 Baptismal Fount is only part of the expansive program of renovation and acquisition of new facilities now in process.  Among those standing near the pool are, Deacon Anthony Baker, chairman of the board; and Mose McClellan, chairman of the board of trustees. - Harris Photo.\"",
