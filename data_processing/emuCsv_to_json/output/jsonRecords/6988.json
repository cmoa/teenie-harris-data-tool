The auditorium seated 3,750, and 2,000 were accommodated in basement, while an estimated 500 waited outside the Mosque.  The capacity crowd, similar to the one which greeted Senator Kennedy recently, heard Vice President Richard M. Nixon, Republican candidate for President, charge his Democratic opponent with irresponsibility and said the Kennedy camp was exploiting religion to aid the campaign of Senator John F. Kennedy.\"",
