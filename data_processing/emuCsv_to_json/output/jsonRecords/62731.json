A1 with question: \"Do you think that too much leniency is shown teenagers who commit crimes?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that they show them enough leniency. They (the authority) should try to help the kids and encourage them to adjust.  I don't mean to punish them, but instead to give them more of a break.  And if they commit a crime again, there should be no leniency.\"",
