The picnic, a circulation-promotion project, under the supervision of A.D. (Jake) Gaither, circulation manager; William Clyde Page, promotion manager, and William G. Nunn Sr., coordinator, was acclaimed a huge success.  Assisting the aforementioned were Leroy Randalll [sic], Carl Davis, Lloyd Tobias, and Donald Williams, distributors, who were mainly responsible for the large turnout.  James D. Drake, promotion art director, acted as co-chairman of the program activities, along with Mr. Davis.  Others who volunteered their services as attendants were Mrs. Bernice Price, Mrs. Lloyd Tobias, Miss Valerie Stewart and Minister Robert X. Davenport of Muhammad Temple of Islam No. 24.  Plenty of good food, baseball, volleyball, and football games, assorted foot races, swimming and rock and roll music kept the newsboys and girls busy throughout the day.
