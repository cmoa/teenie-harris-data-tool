	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. William Dominick, 2313 Mahon Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 4, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that Sherman Adams was guilty of misconduct in office of assistant to the President? Do you think that he should have resigned?\" answer reads: \"No, I wouldn't say that Sherman Adams was guilty of misconduct in office.  And the reason is because of the condition of the country and the world today.  Right now you read of people in high offices who are doing favors for their friends.  In fact, there are many others doing more things than Adams did.  As for his resignation, I say why condemn one man for making one mistake when others are doing the same things only more so.\"",
