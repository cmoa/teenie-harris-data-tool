A2 reads: \"A Happy Occasion - The smiling group of guests exchanged conversation before they took their seats at the speakers' table last Saturday night. The occasion was the ADA's 10th anniversary Roosevelt Day dinner observance in Georgian Room of Webster Hall.  Left to right are U.S. Representative Elmer Holland, Mayor David L. Lawrence, Oregon Senator Richard L. Neuberger, the main speaker; Bresci R.P. Leonard, president, Pittsburgh Chapter ADA, and Councilman Paul F. Jones, general chairman of the affair. Senator Neuberger, earlier in the day, said Adlai Stevenson should be the Democratic Presidential choice.  That stament [sic] might have evoked the happy smiles. - Harris Photo.\"",
