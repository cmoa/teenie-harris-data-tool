	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Michael Pardi, postal service representative, Homewood and Mr. Donald DeRand, Ambridge, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 21, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think students are learning as much under the modern methods of teaching in public schools than students did years ago under the 3 R's (the old teaching method)?\" Mr. Michael Pardi's answer reads: \"It's my personal opinion that children today learn more.  Considering my family, I can see the progress being made, and I think the methods are definitely superior than they were years ago.  I have a child in grade school and the way she is directed to study and the manner in which she's taught are better than the old method.\"  Mr. Donald DeRand's answer reads: \"I believe they are.  The learning methods must be better because I see so many new developments such as the new scientific inventions.\"",
