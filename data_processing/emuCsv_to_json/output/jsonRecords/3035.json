First winning operator was Eleanor Bownes of \"Your House of Beauty\"; second winner,  Sophie Johnson of the same shop; third winner, Rose Purifoy of the Woodson and Hall Beauty Salon.  The first annual conclave of Beauty Shop Owners was the brain child of Mrs. Rose Johnson, president of the group, who called it her \"brain storm\" and she worked energetically to make the affair the history making event that it was.  The second annual conclave will take place the first Sunday in October, 1947, here in Pittsburgh, according to reports.  In last weeks writeup, it was erronously reported that Miss Bertha Ramseur talked to the group.  Instead it was Lillian Evans who gave the assembly her views on the future of the shop owner. - Harris Photo.\"",
