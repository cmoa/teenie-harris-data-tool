At least one family of ill-housed, ill-fed children, age 4 to 9, must pass through this horror of untidiness, day after day - as if it were a front yard - leading to the avenue.  'Winos' dearly love such surroundings, in which to fondle and empty their 'fifths.'  This is the Hill 'jungle,' at its worst. - Harris Photo.\"",
