He didn't have the facilities to pull him back whereas Glenn has such facilities.\"  Mr. Paul Rosenberger's answer reads: \"I think Lindberg, because he faced more of the unknown than Glenn did.  When Lindberg went, it was his own thoughts and idea that he could make it.  In other words, everything depended on him; whereas Glenn had scores of scientists who could have pulled him back and who decided when he was going to make the flight.\"",
