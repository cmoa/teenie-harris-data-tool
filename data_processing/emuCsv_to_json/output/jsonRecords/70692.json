	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Mitchell Jackson, postal officer, East Liberty and Mr. William Kohler Jr., business school graduate, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 21, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think students are learning as much under the modern methods of teaching in public schools than students did years ago under the 3 R's (the old teaching method)?\" Mr. Mitchell Jackson's answer reads: \"I don't think they are learning as much.  I have three children, and, from the observations I have made, I don't think they are learning as much as I did.  The learning is not equal to my level.  And the reflection is on the modern teaching methods.\"  Mr. William Kohler Jr.'s answer reads: \"....Overall I think the modern methods are better.  But it depends on the teacher and whether or not the student wants to learn.\"",
