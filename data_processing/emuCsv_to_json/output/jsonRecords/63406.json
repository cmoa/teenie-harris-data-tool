A1 with question: \"Do you think that theatrical productions like 'The Green Pastures,' which 'take-off' on religions, should be presented as entertainment?\" answer reads: \"I would like to see more programs like 'Green Pastures,' if the producers took out the clowning and made it more serious. Such programs containing a religious message reach a lot of people who do not go to church or only go to church now and then.\"",
