	"CatDescriptText": "Walter Dietz, Pittsburgh, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"Newspapers today influence public opinion as much as they did in the past.  An example of this concerns the views towards Russia.  Because of news and reports in our papers and magazines, the American people are beginning to see Russia as she is--a nation out to spread communism throughout the free world...The presses is reasonably free, but friendship, advertising, and some other things, do influence, to a certain degree, the presentation and coverage.\"",
