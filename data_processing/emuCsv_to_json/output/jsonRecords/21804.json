And I can speak from experience.  During my five years with the Navy I've been to many places in this country and around the world.  And when I speak of race relations, I'm not talking solely about the relations between whites and Negroes, but between all of the races.  Fore instance, the football team which I coach, the Massey Buick team, played the Homewood Scorpions and there were no incidents, just good, hard football and fair play.\"",
