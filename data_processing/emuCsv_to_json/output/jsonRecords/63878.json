B1 with question: \"Do you believe the John James Racket Squad is driving the numbers racket out of Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"I don't know how far he's going towards driving them out, but I do think that he's making them take cover. The raids are making it harder to play the numbers and tend to make the people more careful.  As a result, the numbers players tend to forget about playing.\"",
