	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Emma R. Johnson, housewife, 42 Noblestown Rd., was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 16, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"No, I do not think that we are as friendly as we should be towards Africans.  There are so many ways to be friendlier that they are too numerous to mention.  However I think that we should sweep our won domestic situation clear first and we are not receiving sufficient information about Africa in newspapers.  As for looking down the nose at Africans, I say that we Negroes don't because we realize that both of us are darker races.\"",
