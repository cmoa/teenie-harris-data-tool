If you believe that it is taught do you think that the teaching of it is increasing or diminishing?  If so, by whom do you think that it is taught?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that prejudice is inherent.  I think that it is acquired from friends with whom they associate.  In my opinion, it is decreasing.  I think that people are more open minded today and have a better understanding of their fellowmen [sic].\"",
