Fortunately, however, racial awareness doesn't touch the kids until they are about 11 or 12.  Younger school children get along extremely well.  I've taught at A. Leo Weil School and found that relations among the races were admirable.  However, here in Terrace Village 2, where they should be good also, race relations just are not.\"",
