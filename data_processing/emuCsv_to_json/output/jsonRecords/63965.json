	"CatDescriptText": "Chester Lucas, steel worker, 94 Lafferty Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 15, 1959, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"It's hard for me to believe in capital punishment. A lot of times, when this crime is committed, you just don't know what's in that person's mind.  I don't believe in capital punishment, in 'an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth' because it doesn't work.  However, according to the law, when they should get the chair, the murderer is given life imprisonment.  I don't think that judges are giving the proper protection if they hand out life sentences, which enable the murderer to be free after several years.  If the man confesses to first-degree murder, he should be given a sentence of life and a day, which means that there will be no pardon.  In that way, he is removed from society.\"",
