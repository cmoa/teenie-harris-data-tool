A1 with question: \"How do you think Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States affected relations between our country and Russia? Were you or were you not impressed by his visit to Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"It helped some.  I think that before he came over, he had heard a lot of bad things about us and our country, but now that he has visited here, he sees that they are not true and perhaps the first thing that he thinks about is that we really want peace.  My impression concerning the visit to Pittsburgh and the country in general is that it should have happened a long time ago.\"",
