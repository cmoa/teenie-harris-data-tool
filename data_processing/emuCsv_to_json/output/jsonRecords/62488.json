A1 with question: \"Do you think that the police department states more raids in Negro neighborhoods than in white areas, because there is more crime in former districts?\" answer reads: \"I think that there are more raids because it is the people in the neighborhoods who get the police to conduct the raids. It's bad for the 'after-hour joints' to be in operation and this is what causes the raids.  However, it is good for the people to let the police know about the places.\"",
