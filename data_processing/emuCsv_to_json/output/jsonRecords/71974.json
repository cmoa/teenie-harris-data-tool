O'Connor, foreman, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 16, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the so-called 'store-front' churches, and those who are known generally as 'self-styled preachers,' are an asset or a liability to the community.\" Mr. Lee Jackson's answer reads: \"No comment.  I don't get mixed up in church affairs.\"  Mr. D.J. O'Connor's answer reads: \"I think they are assets.
