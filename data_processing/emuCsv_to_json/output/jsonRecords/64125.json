A1 with question: \"How do you think Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States affected relations between our country and Russia? Were you or were you not impressed by his visit to Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"I don't know if it has, but it could, if it's possible for him to think that we really want peace.  The majority of the people in this country were courteous.  As for his visit to Pittsburgh, well it really didn't impress me one way or the other.  He was just another man visiting our city and our country.\"",
