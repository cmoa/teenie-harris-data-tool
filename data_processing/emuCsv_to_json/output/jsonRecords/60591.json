Brown of 162 Meadow Street, East Liberty, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 5, 1957, pg. 2 with question: \"Should ministers take an active part in politics? Do you believe that they should hold public office?\" John Grier's answer reads: \"I think they should engage in politics on the side so that the people will know what's the best for them.  However, I don't think that they should hold public office.  When I say that they should engage in politics, I mean not actually in the crooked part, but in the Christian way.  The Christian is needed in politics to root out the crooked persons.  It will be good if more enter into the field.\"  Mrs. John E. Brown's answer reads: \"I believe that ministers should participate in politics so that they can advise the people.  However, I don't think that they should run for election to office.  Because such action would take them away from the frame of mind of being a teacher of the Bible.  The main duties of a minister are to teach.\"",
