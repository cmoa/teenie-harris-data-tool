A1 with question: \"Do you think that the Wacs and others women's units, with the exception of nurses, should be abolished in armed services during peacetime? Why?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that they should be a part of the armed forces during peace time.  There are a lot of boys on the street who should be working, but are unemployed.  Therefore, the armed forces is the place for them.  The women in the service are in jobs in which those unemployed men and boys could serve.\"",
