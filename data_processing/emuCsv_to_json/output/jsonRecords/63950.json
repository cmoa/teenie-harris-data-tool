B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" answer reads: \"I couldn't say because I have not heard or read of enough cases. However, I don't believe that every case warrants the electric chair.  There are a few cases where the confessed murderer deserved the electric chair and did not receive it.\"",
