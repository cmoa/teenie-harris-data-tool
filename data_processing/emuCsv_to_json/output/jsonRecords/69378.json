	"CatDescriptText": "John O' Hagan, student, Lawrenceville and Carl Walzer, student, Bloomfield, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, December 3, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that integration in all schools in the South should be effected immediately, or do you favor permitting a reasonable length of time?  If so, how long a period do you consider as a \"reasonable length of time?\"  Mr. O'Hagan's answer reads: \"A reasonable amount of time should be given.  Because of the attitudes there, it would be hard to force integration.  It's hard to say just how much time is reasonable.\"  Mr. Walzer's answer reads: \"Integration should start early and be left up to the South.  This would tend to reduce tension.  The time allowed should be long enough to give the people a chance to calm down, because they are pretty roused up and excited now.\"",
