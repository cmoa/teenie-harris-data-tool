	"CatDescriptText": "Patricia Pietrzyk, senior high school student, Wilkinsburg, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 30, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"I think that the single woman makes the better teacher because she has more time to spend with the children.  She is not as fully occupied as a married woman, and therefore is more patient and generally speaking has a better and pleasanter [sic] attitude.  I think that it's optional whether or not to use men as elementary school teachers.\"",
