A1 with question: \"How do you think Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States affected relations between our country and Russia? Were you or were you not impressed by his visit to Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"It has eased tension and as a result is good for both sides.  I think that in the end there will be some sort of general agreement between the two... I was impressed by the Pittsburgh visit.  The people really turned out mainly because of curiosity, and they and the U.S. people in general were delightful in their courtesy.\"",
