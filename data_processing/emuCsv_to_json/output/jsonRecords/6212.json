Frank Silvera... stepped once more into our life with a magnificent rave performance. Frank Silvera is a Bostonian... a 'few' years ago... we were both members of the late, lamented, but never forgotten Boston Players, an amateur group. As he says, our paths were straight... his continued into play after play... movie after movie... to TV... while we went straight on with our fiction writing... and on into newspaper work.\"",
