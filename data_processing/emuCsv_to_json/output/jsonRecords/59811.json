Several of the large families have been given notice to move. Note one of many windows in the structures boarded up with cardboard. Doors leading to front hall stay open winter and summer since there are no panes in them. Window beside one with cardboard has been recently patched. Many large families are forced to live in places through the city as bad or worse than this one. - Harris Photo.\"",
