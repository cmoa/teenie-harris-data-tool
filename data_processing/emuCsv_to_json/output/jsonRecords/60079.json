	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. David Beatty, 2012 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 30, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"I think that the teachers who are married are better than single persons.  With a single person, everything happens in schools.  I think that they should be women who have husbands, and therefore, they will have a better understanding.  Yes, I think that it is all right for a man to teach school.\"",
