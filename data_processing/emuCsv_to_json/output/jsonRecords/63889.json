	"CatDescriptText": "George Knox, 96 Rivermont Dr., was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 25, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you think children should be given 'allowances' (money)? If so, for what reason or reasons (just to have spending money or for chores done around the house, etc.)?  Do you think that it helps or hinders the development of the youngster?\" answer reads: \"Yes, to a certain extent.  For instance, you should not give a five-year-old child the same amount that you would to an 18 or 19-year-old youth.  It should be given, specifically, because of crime.  If youths are given allowances, I don't think there will be a lot of crimes.  The money should be given for work done.\"",
