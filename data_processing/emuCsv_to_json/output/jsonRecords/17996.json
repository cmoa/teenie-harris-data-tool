This will be the most talked about 'Fair' ever.  From the opening night when thousands began to gather at the doors, to the final session, when the laughter of prize winners waved emotionally with the disappointed non-winners, the exhibitors and participants worked enthusiastically from their national and local booths to accommodate the happy homemakers.  Beautifully decorated booths, sweet organ music augmented by the 'rock 'em, sock 'em' jazz of Sarah McLawler's combo, set the mood for the huge audiences...(11) Crowd pleasers were Jacqueline (Jackie) Lewis, introduced as 'Vicky' from the North Side Packing Company booth, and the Fabulous Bobby Jones who 'soothed' the crowds with melodious organ music. The Hammond Organ with Twin stereophonic speakers was furnished by the C. C. Mellor Company. - Harris Photos.\"",
