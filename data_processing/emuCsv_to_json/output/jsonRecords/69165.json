Washington and Emanuel Mollett, distribution clerk, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, June 10, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that the 'Freedom Riders' should accede to Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy's request for a 'cooling-off' period in their program to test segregation laws of certain Southern states?\" George Christian's answer reads: \"I figure like this- if they cool off now, they never will get started again.  There should be no cooling-off period.\"  Emanuel Mollett's answer reads: \"Because the 'Freedom Riders' have received an unofficial sanction from the Government, they could comply with in reason.  But there should not be a complete let-up.  They should still continue to test, but only a few, not as many as before.  And those that have already been started should continue.\"",
