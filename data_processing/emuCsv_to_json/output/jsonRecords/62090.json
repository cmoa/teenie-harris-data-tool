	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Irene Johnson, 55 Independence Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 31, 1958, pg. A1 question reads: \"Do you think people follow political leadership more than religious leadership? Why?\" answer reads: \"Some do and some don't.  I think that the majority of people are more politically led than religiously led.  And the reason for this, I think, is because that the people, more or less, have their jobs to hold.  That's what keeps the city and the town in working order, and even the minister himself has to depend on the economic situation for his support.\"",
