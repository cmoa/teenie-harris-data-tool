A fine voice, the barks of a dog, both in rear yard behind the home of bailbondsman Lehman Smith and the Sachem Alley spot where the body of 10-year-old Julia Mae Johnson was found, have led detectives to believe that the July 10 rape - strangulation of the girl may have happened there.  The report of these happenings was given to homicide detectives by Mrs. Rose Smith of 444 Sachem Way.  The entrance to the rear lot is pictured above (marked 'in' on the tail end of the arrow).  The lot behind two fences can be seen where the clothes are hanging in the top picture.  One can see and hear what happens in the Mitchell hall from this point.  The sex maniac may have stood in the rear lot, after raping and killing the little girl, in the garden plot (pictured in the lower right hand picture the entrance to which is marked 'out'), until the opportune moment to bring the body out and place it on the sofa (marked cot spot in the top picture).  The sofa blocked the gate shown.  Possibly the only eye-witness to the brutal attack is a small white dog, 'Rascal,' who belongs to Mrs. Mamie Singleton who lives in the rear of 444 Sachem Way. Mrs. Rose Smith, who lives in the apartment whose door is pictured in the lower right hand photo, heard the dog barking loudly after a fine voice spoke several words.  Since the night of the murder, the dog cowers at the approach of people and seldom barks. - (Harris Photos).\"",
