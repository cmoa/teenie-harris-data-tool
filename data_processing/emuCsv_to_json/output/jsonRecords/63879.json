A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"Yes, because the mills, restaurants, and other places are open on Sundays.  And I think that it would be all right for the taverns to be open on Sundays because it would provide more jobs for people.\"",
