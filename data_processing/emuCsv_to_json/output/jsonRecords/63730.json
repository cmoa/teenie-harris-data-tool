	"CatDescriptText": "Dr. Ernest V. May, executive secretary of the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\"  Answer reads: \"My opinion is that laws are quite necessary as factors essential towards moulding opinion to bring about a change of heart.  The law is a very important part of settling a goal for human achievement.  I had hoped that the President might have been more positive at this time.\"",
