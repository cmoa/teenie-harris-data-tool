Say, about 500 more?\"  Mr. Jefferson's answer reads: \"An increase in the wage tax would be justified to provide additional policemen...For example, in Homewood, we are experiencing a more secure feeling, because beat policemen have been restored...I am 100 per cent for an increase.\"  Mr. Stevenson's answer reads: \"Yes.  We need more policemen because of the growing population.\"",
