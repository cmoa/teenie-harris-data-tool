A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\"  Answer reads: \"Judging from my experience in school, I don't think that they are.  It is basic in school that the teacher knows your talents and abilities and therefore helps you to channel them into the best fields.  This was not the case for me.  The interested teacher can see the poor use which you are making of your talents and be able to help straighten  you out.\"",
