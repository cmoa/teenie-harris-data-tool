A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"It depends on the age of the child. Perhaps for a student in Senior High School it is alright for him to work for about four hours, if he has the time enough to get home and do his homework.  As for the other grades any child in a grade below Senior High School should not be allowed to work after school.\"",
