With her are her parents Mr. and Mrs. William Dix, left, and her sister Mrs. Carrie Ann Dix James and her son William Christopher James - Harris Photo.\"  Accompanying article by Toki Schalk Johnson reads: \"Indian summer sent warming rays of golden sunlight on the city of McKeesport last week to make the top flight social events taking place, happy riches of delight.  The celebrated Semper Fidelis Club gave its fourth annual 'Woman of the Year' luncheon.  It was just a marvelous excuse for the feminine guests to arrive in glittering splendor to honor Miss Jeanne Dix, teacher in Pittsburgh School System.  Adding to an exciting afternoon, John Clay, young designer, showed some of his own creations, and then demonstrated how he designs with brush and paint. Another day, the home of Mrs. Virginia Gittens was a joyous spot when the Mothers Club surprised devoted member Mrs. Samuel Ethel Golden with a handkerchief shower.  It's moments like these that make life worth living and club work more enjoyable. - Toki Johnson.\"",
