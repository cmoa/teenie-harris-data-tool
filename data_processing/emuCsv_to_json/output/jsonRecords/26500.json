Spangler, 77, of 1140 Wheeler Street, second photo from left, shows a redecorated wastepaper basket to Mrs. William H. Starling, one of the hostesses and a voluntary chairman of the shop...Other entrants, not shown, were Mrs. Cornelia Young, of the Lemington Avenue Home, who although partially blind, crocheted a rug, and John Writt, 80, who fabricated a \"mobile,\" a hanging collection of suspended card board figures, and painted several pictures as his entries.  The Social Service Department of the Mount Lebanon Women's Club, Mrs. Donald O. Northrup, chairman, on Thursday, gave a reception at the Arts and Crafts Center for the exhibitors.

Mrs. Williams, who said she first started making quilts as a \"really young girl\" in Rome, Ga., also entered an Eastern Star Handkerchief...-Harris PHotos.\"",
