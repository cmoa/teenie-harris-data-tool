The blaze scorched and blistered the Williams' family home and threatened four families, consisting of lone mothers and a total of 23 children.  These families have not yet been relocated from the Ingram Palace project.  Some of the children can be seen playing in front of the damaged house.  Most of these youngsters and their mothers have been shifted from one hovel to another all of their lives. - Harris Photo.\"",
