Beachler, radio-tv editorial writer, 286 Parkway Drive, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 5, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should press in the fight for civil rights, or should they seek them through such medium as conciliation, persuasion and patience?\" Lois Roberts' answer reads: \"Not patience, because our patience has run out...It should be pressure.\"  Edwin H. Beachler's answer reads: \"I think you have to press some, but there should be more effort through conciliation and working together...You don't want a conflict.  You can draw a parallel to the problems of labor and management and in this situation you cannot have the sides at each other's throat.  The same goes for the civil rights issue.\"",
