For long periods of time nary a customer entered the emporium for a spot of the stuff which made the late John Barrymore and W. C. Fields famous. Shelves were full of whiskey, gin, rum and wine, but takers were few and far between. The top photo is a scene at the State store at Sixth and Wylie Avenues showing clerks Lillian Asaf and Charles Coleman... Some customers ignore the end of liquor rationing Monday giving State store clerks a chance to catch up on paper work. - Harris Photo.\" [Accompanying image is of lines at grocery store of people buying butter instead.]",
