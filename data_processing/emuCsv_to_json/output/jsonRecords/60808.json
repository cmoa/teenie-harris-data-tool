Why?\" Mr. Joseph Nicholson's answer reads: \"I don't think that they are.  The licensed places have certain hours of closing and therefore make people go home, whereas speakeasies keep the people up all night and they don't go home.  In the gambling joints and speakeasies they cater to all types of persons.\" Mr. Dan Akers answer reads: \"Speakeasies are always harmful especially in raising families.  As for the licensed taverns, well, I've never given them any thought.\"",
