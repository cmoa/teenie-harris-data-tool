	"CatDescriptText": "Titus McCue, trucker, 232 Clifton Street, Sharpsburg, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 31, 1959, pg. 32 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment? If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"I say that it depends on the crime.  If the murder, is one of first degree, that is a planned one, the death penalty should be imposed.  However, if it's from a fight, which just sprung up, the death penalty should not be imposed.  I believe in an eye-for-an-eye, and a tooth-for-a-tooth type of justice.  And so far as youths under 21 years of age, when a person is 17, he knows what he is doing.\"",
