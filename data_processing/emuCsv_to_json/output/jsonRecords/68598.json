A1  with question: \"In your opinion what political party has done the most for the Negroes?\" Miss Judy McNerney's answer reads: \"Democrats, and the reason is that a lot of Democrats are Catholic, and Catholics are more tolerable.\"  Mr. N.A. Williams' answer reads: \"Within the last four years, I would say that the Republicans have done the most.  Before that, however, Roosevelt had done more to help the Negro.  The Republicans today are working on all levels.  They have opened the eyes of the Democrats who now are doing what is right.\"",
