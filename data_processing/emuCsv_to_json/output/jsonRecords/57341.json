Shown in picture also are (extreme left) Mrs. Marion B. Jordon, executive secretary of the NAACP, who was left without any testimonial support when two youngsters whom she had been requested to file the information for, were absent.  Atty. Everett E. Utterback (second from left), who presented the case, agreed with Bastianini's attorney, Owen W. McManus Jr., that there was not enough evidence against Bastianini and the two attorneys requested the dismissal from Alderman Harry B. Fitzgerald.  The high school students in the picture are some of the boys and girls who claim they were denied entrance to an April 15 disc jockey dance at the firehall because they are Negroes. - Harris Photo.\"",
