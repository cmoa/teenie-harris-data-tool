Why?\" Mrs. Scott's answer reads: \"They consider our vote important, because we are taxpayers and a great many of us are homeowners.\"  Mrs. Williams' answer reads: \"There are policymakers [sic] who do, because Negroes have done so much and proved worthy.  However, they don't show as much respect as they should and I think that is because that once they are in power they tend to forget those persons who put them into power.\"",
