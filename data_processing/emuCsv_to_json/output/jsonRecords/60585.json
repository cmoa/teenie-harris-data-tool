	"CatDescriptText": "Janet Roberts, 721 Idlewild Street and Geraldine Williams 7142 Race Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 5, 1957, pg. 2 with question: \"Should ministers take an active part in politics? Do you believe that they should hold public office?\" Janet Roberts' answer reads: \"Yes, I think ministers should take an active part in politics, because I believe that everybody should.  However, I don't think that they should hold public office.  They have a big enough job running the church.\"  Geraldine Williams' answer reads: \"Generally, I think that it's all right for ministers to inform their flocks about city government, and to get them to register and to vote.  And certainly if they are qualified, ministers should hold public office.  Holding a public office shouldn't interfere with conducting church.  A minister should be able to take care of a public office job during the week.  During Sunday he can well take care of the church's needs.  However, he shouldn't come into church talking about politics and his political job.\"",
