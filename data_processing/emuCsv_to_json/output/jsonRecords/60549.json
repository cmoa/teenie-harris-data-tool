	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Addie Harper, 3201 Camp Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 17, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Last week a Courier reader, who is an active church member, in a letter of complaint, criticized Baptist ministers because of the manner in which they conduct church affairs. As a result, a Courier reporter, conducting a 'man-in-the-street' interview, asked the following questions, after the interviewee had read the letter: Does your minister.... Stand at the door and shake hands with the members of the congregation, after services are over?  Visits the sick members of the church regularly? money?[sic]  Continually beg for money?  Preach pointless and lengthy sermons?  Permit the deacons to intone long prayers, when called upon to pray?\"  answer reads: \"I changed not because of any shortcomings of the Baptist faith but because my in-laws are all Methodists.  In regards to the letter, I might say that Baptist ministers don't ask for any more money than pastors of other denominations.  I've noticed that most Baptist ministers do not go to the exit and shake hands but remain at the pulpit.  I think it would be much better if they did shake hands at the exit.  By the time the service ends, a mother is too tired by the annoyances of the children to journey to the alter to shake hands with the minister.\"",
