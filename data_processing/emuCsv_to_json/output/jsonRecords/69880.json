	"CatDescriptText": "Dorothy Wilson, housewife, Schenley Heights and Sam Griffin, pensioner, Fifth Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 9, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Whom do you think the Democratic and the Republican parties will choose for their respective presidential candidates? Why?\" Mrs. Wilson's answer reads: \"Adlai Stevenson probably will be the Democratic candidate.  The reason is that he's neutral and probably will mean security for this country because he has the know-how.  However, I don't think any of the candidates are for the colored man.  I don't see why we don't nominate our own candidates. Even though they wouldn't be elected, at lease [least] they would gain some recognition.  As for the Republicans, I think that Rockefeller is in the number one position.\"  Mr. Griffin's answer reads: \"I would like to see Kennedy nominated, and I thin kthat it probably will be Kennedy.  I think that f ro the Republicans, Nixon is out. I don't know who will be the GOP choice.\"",
