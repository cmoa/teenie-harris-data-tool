A2, reads: \"Neighbors Thwart Attempted Rape of Girl, 12 - When a stranger, Donald Meyers, 25, of 541 Francis St., met an Allequippa St. girl, 12, as she was returning home with a bag of groceries at about 9:30 P. M., Monday, police said Meyers put a knife (bottom right photo) on her neck, walked her down the unlighted walkway (top right photo shows spot where he met her and is marked with X), and down the steps shown by arrow to a basement areaway, leading to a cellar door of one of the project houses (bottom left).  Police added, he threatened her life if she refused him.  She screamed.  Joanne Jordan Miller, 12, looked out a window and screamed.  A passing motorist, Ralph Hughes, 2411 Bedford Ave., and a visiting neighbor, Albert Scott, 25, of 201 Burrows St., came to the victim's rescue and grappled with her attacker.  Meyers fled, leaving the knife behind, but was caught by Traffic Patrolman J. Walsh at the Boulevard of the Allies ramp as police cars converged on the scene, after having been called by Patrolman John Davis, who had summoned them to the scene.  Neighbors in the area, which is across the street from a fire station, say no bulb has been in the light socket on a utility pole above the steps, for months, and no street lights exist on this block of Allequippa St.  Also, they charge that police protection is poor.  Meyers, who had been released from the penitentiary recently, was held for court after a hearing in Morals Court. - Harris Photo.\"",
