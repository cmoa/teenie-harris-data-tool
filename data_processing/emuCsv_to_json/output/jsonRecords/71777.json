Why?\"  Ms. Grey's answer reads: \"...To a certain extent they are.  They realize we want freedom the same as Negroes in other areas.  I think the majority of Negroes in Pittsburgh are working together to secure first-class citizenship.\"  Mr. White's answer reads: \"Not in Pittsburgh, like they are in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. it seems as though Negroes here don't care.\"",
