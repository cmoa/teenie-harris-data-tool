A1 with question: \"Do you think Negro business places should have the right to operate in Lower Hill after that section has been beautified?\"  Answer reads: \"Of course, but if the Negroes do not have the money he shouldn't locate there. In fact, I think that the property is at such a high value that even if the Negro wanted to get a place there the price is so jacked up that he would not be able to do so.\"",
