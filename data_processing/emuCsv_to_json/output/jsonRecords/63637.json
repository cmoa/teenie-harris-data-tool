A1 with question: \"Do you believe Negroes, who get public assistance, do more cheating than whites?\" answer reads: \"I would say whites. And I might add that I know of several cases where people who need public assistance cannot receive it.  As for who cheats the most, I will say that I've found out that the colored race will go a long way before they start to try to get something for nothing.  This is not true with the other race.\"",
