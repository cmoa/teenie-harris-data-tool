	"CatDescriptText": "Anne Comer, church worker and housewife, Arlington Heights and James Wardlow, medical service representative, Bethel Park, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, May 6, 1961, pg. 7  with question: \"Which of these reasons do you believe is the cause of many citizens not voting: (1) Belief that 'political machine-backed' candidates are hard to defeat? (2) Lack of interest in who runs their government?\" Ms. Cormer's answer reads: \"...Lack of interest, and I think this is because people don't read enough about the men who run for office, and there's not enough exposure of candidates on such things as television...\"  Mr. Wardlow's answer reads: \"...Lack of interest in who runs their government...It's apathy...I think it's hard for one man out of 189 million to think he has an affect on the vote outcome.  And, also, I think the lack of interest is because people are not informed, or do not know what the policy is going to be until after a candidate wins office and then puts his policy into effect.  Cuba is a good example of this.\"",
