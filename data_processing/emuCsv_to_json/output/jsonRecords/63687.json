A1 with question: \"Do you believe churches of any denomination receive appreciation financial help from racketeers?\" answer reads:  with question: \"Do you believe churches of any denomination receive appreciation financial help from racketeers?\" answer reads: \"Indirectly, a lot of them do.  Directly, I don't think they should and I don't believe that they do.  You know it to be a fact that most ministers don't condone the rackets.  However, racket money comes into the church sometimes during special fund drives.  This is because solicitors, in getting contributions, go unknowingly to some persons who are racketeers.  However, I say that if the church solicitor knows that the money is coming from a racketeer, he should not accept it.\"",
