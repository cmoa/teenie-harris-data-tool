George C. Wallace at the Amen Corner Dinner. The demonstrators converged upon the hotel after a march from 'Freedom Corner' Crawford and Centre.  The hotel was completely surrounded, and silent onlookers swelled the crowd to 4500 to 5000 persons in area.  The demonstration was orderly and peaceful, but police were standing nearby in the event of any incidents.  Officers at all entrances carried 3-foot long riot sticks, but riot helmets were not worn.  The demonstrators came from nearly all phases of Pittsburgh life, Ministers, politicians, beatniks, children, whites, the young and old marched, danced, sang, and prayed around the hotel. The demonstration lasted about three hours, and both Civil Rights leaders and Police Officers call it the largest demonstration in the history of Pittsburgh.  Harris Photos.\"",
