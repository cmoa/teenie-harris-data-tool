A1 with question: \"Do you think children should be given 'allowances' (money)? If so, for what reason or reasons (just to have spending money or for chores done around the home, etc.)?  Do you think that it helps or hinders the development of the youngster?\" answer reads: \"Yes, because it will give the children more freedom to buy what they want.  And they should earn it.  This way, they will have a tendency not to spend it foolishly.\"",
