	"CatDescriptText": "Barry Harris, messenger, East Liberty and Ronald Ragin, dishwasher, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 17, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"Do you believe that an accused person, scheduled for an appearance before a jury, is actually judged by a \"jury of his peers\" (laborers, housewives, rich, poor, Catholic, Jew of Protestant, Negro and white, Northerner, Southerner, Easterner or Westerner, etc.) or is the jury more or less handpicked to satisfy the whims of the prosecution and defense lawyers?\"  Mr. Harris' answer reads: \"The juries are not handpicked.  It seems to me, however, that they tend to judge a person not by his religion, but by his high-ranking.  In other words, it's harder for a person of prominent rank to receive a fair trial.  Average persons unually receive fair trials.\"  Mr. Ragin's answer reads: \"I think the jury is one of the defendant's peers.  That is, of the various groups which make-up the population.  And I think juries are unfair in most cases.\"",
