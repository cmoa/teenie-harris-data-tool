	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. William Berger, attorney ,Squirrel Hill and Mr. Willis Morris, electrician's helper, Belmar Gardens, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 4, 1961, pg. 10 with question: \"Do you think that there is any need for building bomb shelters?  If so, who should build them--the individual citizens or the Federal Government?\" Mr. William Berger's answer reads: \"Without question, we need them...As for who should build them, I think that with individual citizens building them, the results will be too haphazard, and also there's no set plan and it creates a difficulty between the people who have them and those who don't have them.  Also, individual building of them tends to lead to exploitation of the private citizen.  It's practically a joke the way fallout shelters are being built now.  Therefore, the Government must build them.\"  Mr. Willis Morris' answer reads: \"Yes, because they will help to protect persons against fallout. The government should build them because they are getting paid to look out for the welfare of the people.\"",
