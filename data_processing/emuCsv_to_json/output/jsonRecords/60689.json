My reason is because that when such things as trolleys, buses, and taxicabs strike, they make things tough for the majority of people.  For instance, my sister-in-law has to go all the way to Sheridan each day for work.\"  Miss Edith Henry answer reads: \"I think there should be a law.  People have to depend very much on these things, and especially the street cars, to get back and forth to work.\"",
