	"CatDescriptText": "Velma Ellis, 207 Kearns Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 1, 1958 with question: \"Should parents compel children who are still students in high school or college to work to help support the family?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that the child should if he is supporting himself as he goes through college. In fact, the parents probably need to help him.  However, the child should do as much as he can, because it gives him or her a sense of responsibility.  As for high school students, if they have a little job, I don't see any wrong in their contributing to the family's support, if the children have an income.\"",
