A1 with question: \"Do you think that 18-year-olds should be given the privilege of voting?\" answer reads: \"I do not know. Perhaps, around 19 or 20.  But, at the age of 18, the youths, nowadays, seem to want to take to rock 'n' roll and other activities which discredit the race.  I'm a deacon at Calvary Baptist Church, and teach them in Sunday school and therefore, can see how unstable they are.  Perhaps, better jobs would help them to grow up sooner.\"",
