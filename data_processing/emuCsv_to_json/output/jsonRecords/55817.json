The conference was sponsored by the Youth Department of the Branch, with Clarence Rogers Jr. serving as general chairman and Delores Gary secretary.  Jody Harris, acting boys' work secretary of the \"YM,\" supervised the Planning Committee which did an excellent job.  Theme of the conference was \"As the Walls Come Tumbling Down,\" and the 110 delegates from various high schools throughout the area were constantly reminded of the preparation required to meet the demands of integration in employment and social living.  Saturday evening at the banquet, the delegates heard an inspiring address by Atty. James B. Simmons Jr., City Councilman of Toledo, Ohio...Lower left and right, some of the smart, well-groomed, charming and handsome delegates who, during the conference sessions, displayed remarkable poise and intelligence in discussion and also other commendable traits of leadership...-Harris Photo.\"",
