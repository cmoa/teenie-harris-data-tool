	"CatDescriptText": "Sidney Gelb, college student, 3700 Orpwood Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 10, 1959, pg. 6 with question: \"With Mayor Lawrence performing his duties as Governor in Harrisburg, do you believe the Democratic party in Pittsburgh will be weakened by his absence?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  And the reason is that when you ask the question, 'Where is the party whip to take Lawrence's place here?\" you can't think of a man who can replace the Mayor.  The replacement is so hard because Mayor Lawrence is such a dynamic man, and accomplishes so much.\"",
