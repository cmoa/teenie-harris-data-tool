	"CatDescriptText": "Helen Johnson, 1313 Locust Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 1, 1958 pg 4 with question: \"Should parents compel children who are still students in high school or college to work to help support the family?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so. The child didn't bring himself here, and, therefor, he should not have to work on his parents' problems.  It is perfectly all right for him to work for himself.  For instance, I have eight children and they have worked for themselves to buy clothing and have a little more change.  The children should not bring the money home for the payment of family bills.  The only thing the parents should do is to supervise it to make certain that the kids do not waste the money and that they do save a portion of it.  It is thrifty for the kids to have a job after school, but not for the support of the family.  It seems to me as though it really discourages a child to make him bring his earnings home and to put them into the 'pot' and give him nothing.\"",
