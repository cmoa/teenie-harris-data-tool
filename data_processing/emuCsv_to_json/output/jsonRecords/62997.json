	"CatDescriptText": "Allen Anderson, custodian, 357 Orchard Drive, Crafton, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 24, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the increasing demand for father and mother to work, thus taking both parents out of the home for the better part of the day, affects their children as regards discipline, ambition, and social compatibility in general?\" answer reads: \"Generally speaking, I think that it depends on the age of the children as to whether or not they can understand why his parents are working and away from home.  And I think that it is very important that the parents make a good effort towards explaining to the children the reason why they are working away from home.  However, regardless of what you do, it is still going to have a bad effect on the children to have both parents away from home working.  Even in case of teenagers, one of the parents should be there.\"",
