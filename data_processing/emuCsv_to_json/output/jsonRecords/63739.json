	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Shirley Ross, housewife, 136 Chalfont Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 11, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in the schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I think that there is adequate counseling.  The classes are crowded today, but I think teachers are giving the children the benefit of their skills and training, and if the students are willing to learn, they will become better prepared for later life.  The program could be better by hiring more teachers.\"",
