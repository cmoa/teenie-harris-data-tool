Responding to the request of Miss Patricia Hays (top left photo), who had discovered his talents, Mr. Hamiel has been painting story-book characters, like those in top left photo.  His work has greatly enlivened interest in a weekly story telling hour. In the other photos, Mr. Hamiel is shown with some of his other paintings which he explains as \"just puttering around in paint.\" - Harris Photos.\"",
