	"CatDescriptText": "Helen Mozella Lawrence, 811 Inwood Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 12, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Should well defined courses in sex education be taught in the public school system? If so, at what grade should the teaching of these courses begin?\" answer reads: \"It should begin at quite an early age because the kids today are more intelligent.  If it begins in the schools and the home, and I do include the home, there will be less tragedies, less mistakes.  Quite often we think that only the girls make the mistakes, but this is not so, and for that reason I say that the education should be for the boys as well as the girls because they also make mistakes.  The courses should begin between the ages of ten and twelve.  The other races starts their kids at an early age and I've wondered why we don't do the same.  I know about the other race because I've worked with them.  Their children begin receiving instructions and they are given books and other things to help them.\"",
