A1, with question: \"Do you believe in divorce even though most religious groups frown upon it, and some actually ban it except under very extenuating circumstances?\" answer reads: \"I'm a Catholic and I don't believe in divorce. That's what's wrong with the world today, and the reason for so many broken homes.  Divorces are so easy to get.  My father and mother have been married for 58 years.\"",
