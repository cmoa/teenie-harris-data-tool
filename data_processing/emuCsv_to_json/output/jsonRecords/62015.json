	"CatDescriptText": "James Kidd, 504 Center Street, Braddock, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 15, 1958, pg. 2 �Do you think that the numbers game should be legalized or outlawed?� answer reads: �Maybe they should be legalized. Numbers are going to be played, it seems, and therefore, by legalizing them, there won�t be as much illegal conduct to fight.  Also, the cost to the taxpayer will not be teh expense of such things as police raids and court procedures.  The reason I say these things is not that I am so much for the numbers, but because I�m facing things as they are.�",
