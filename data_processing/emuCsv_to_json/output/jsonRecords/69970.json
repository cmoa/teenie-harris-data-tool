	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Robert Thomas, janitor, Third Ward and Mr. Joseph Lewis, janitor, Homewood, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 25, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be held responsible, to the extent of being arrested, and fined, or imprisoned, (like the responsibility for their children's attendance at school) for the delinquency practices of their respective teen-age children?\" Mr. Robert Thomas' answer reads: \"I don't think they should.  When kids grow to be teen-agers, sometimes they stray away and join the wrong bunch and are wrapped in trouble and are not aware of it until they are in it.\"  Mr. Joseph Lewis' answer reads: \"I think the parents should be charged with the custody of the children, but when the children are over 21, the parents should not be arrested and jailed and fined when their children do wrong.\"",
