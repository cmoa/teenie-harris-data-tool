	"CatDescriptText": "Myra Hill, housewife, 1832 Runnette Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 4, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that theatrical productions like 'The Green Pastures,' which 'take-off' on religions, should be presented as entertainment?\" answer reads: \"I think that 'Green Pastures' was blasphemy. I objected to the use of the Negro dialect and the fact that the cast was all Negro.  Also, I especially did not like such parts as the 'God' who was not sure of himself concerning whether or they 'firmament' or whatever the drink was, was 'strong enough.'\"",
