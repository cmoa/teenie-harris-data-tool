Reynolds, Alcoa employee, New Kensington, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 10, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Who had the more dangerous assignment--Lindbergh or Glenn?\" Miss Janet Fleishman's answer reads: \"I think Glenn, because Lindberg knew what was going on, whereas Glenn was not so sure about the space and was traveling in the unknown.  Glenn is a very brave man.\"  Mr. W.L. Reynolds' answer reads: \"Both were tough assignments...Lindberg, perhaps, was the braver because he was facing a completely unknown atmosphere, wheras [sic] Glenn had been preceded by others-- two Americans and one Russian.\"",
