	"CatDescriptText": "George H. Washington, janitor, Homewood, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 6, 1959, pg. 1 with question: \"Do you think that racial prejudice is inherent or is it taught to children? If you believe that it is taught do you think that the teaching of it is increasing or diminishing?  If so, by whom do you think that it is taught?\" answer reads: \"I think that they are taught, and I do believe that the teaching of hate is increasing.  In a lot of the cases, the kids receive it from others, but these children at first receive it from grown-ups.  Yes, prejudice is increasing in my opinion, and the reason is not so much that it is taught, but because hate like one rotten apple in a barrel, spoils the other good ones.\"",
