A1 with question: \"Do you favor an increase in state sales tax or a graduated income tax as a means of raising revenue for a commonwealth of Pennsylvania?\" answer reads: \"A graduated income tax is better, in this way, everybody will be paying where as with the sales tax the state would miss some income because a lot of people do not buy things like cigarettes and alcoholic drinks, which are taxable. By a graduated income tax, the responsibility of supporting the state will teach everybody and will be fair.\"",
