Walter Williams, Uniontown and Mr. Frank Buckner, porter, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 1, 1961, pg. A1  with question: \"Do you think ethnic groups (like the Negro people) profit more by voting a straight party ticket, or are there better advantages for them in splitting a ticket?\" Rev. Walter Williams' answer reads: \"My candid opinion is that as a group, in order to get things done when we want them done, we should learn how from the Jews.  What they do is to get together.  If the Negroes, as an ethnic grouped, soal [sic] themselves together and turn out a solid vote, I believe things will be better soon.\"  Mr. Frank Buckner's answer reads: \"I believe that should be one way...Say, if a man votes straight Democratic, eventually, someone good will be voted into office and this person will look out for the Negro, because he will realize that the Negro vote controls a great deal.  But first, we should get together among ourselves.\"",
