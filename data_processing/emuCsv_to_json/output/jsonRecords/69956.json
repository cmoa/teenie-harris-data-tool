A1 with question: \"What do you think the main issues will be, or should be, in the coming presidential campaign?\" Mr. Leibowitz's answer reads: \"The wage law ought to be a major issue.  Wages should be at least $1.25 an hour and there should be a 40-hour work law to give more people jobs.  The big unemployment problem is another issue.  \"CCC camps should be started again to help keep the youths off the streets and reduce the crime rate.\"  Mr. Clark's answer reads: \"There should be more civil rights and more voice for the NAACP.\"",
