Lee, sign painter, 1627 Fifth Avenue and Miss Beatrice Morphis, 2117 Wylie Avenue, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 28, 1957, pg. 3, with question: \"What do you think of race relations here in Pittsburgh?\"  Lain L. Lee's answer reads: \"In some areas of Pittsburgh race relations are very good, while in others they are very poor.  Using a school rating system, I would say that this city's score on a race relations test is a 'C' minus.  Since 'C' is the passing grade, Pittsburgh's score, in my estimation, is not quite passing.\"  And Beatrice Morphis's answer reads: \"The race situation is not too bad, but, it could be a lot better.  Especially in fair employment.  For instance, I'm a qualified comptometrist [sic], but have been unable to find a job during a five-month search.\"",
