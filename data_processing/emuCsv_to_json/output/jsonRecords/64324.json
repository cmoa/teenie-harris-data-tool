Barbour read: \"In spite of statements by five big business corporations' personnel officials in last week's edition of The Courier, that their respective businesses hired employes [employees] on the basis of qualifications and not race, a spot check among some applicants for jobs in Pittsburgh area industries revealed that most of them believe they have been given the 'run-around' because of their race. ...several college graduated who opined that they are resigned to a fate which has dealt harshly with  them.  They have adjusted themselves in jobs not in their professions.  One is Thaddeus Mosley of St. Clair Village, a father of two children.  Mosley has a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Pittsburgh. 'But I haven't looked for a job in my field for the past three years or four years,' he remarked.  Before and after the 1951 graduation from Pitt, Mosley had conducted an intensive hunt to be hired.  Today he tells you that 'after a while the spirit is broken and you are disgusted.'  He explained that he had answered advertisements for jobs in various Pittsburgh businesses.  They included local newspapers, a radio broadcasting station, and a large industrial concern.  Mosley identified the large corporation as one whose personnel manager last week told the Courier that the concern hires all persons who are qualified for job openings.  'To me that is a lot of doubletalk when they say they hire all qualified persons,' Mosley said.  'When I attempted to be hired by them, a representative told me that it seems that the Pittsburgh Courier could use a qualified Negro, because we have no openings.'...",
