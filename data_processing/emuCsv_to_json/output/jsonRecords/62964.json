A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"No, I think that it is good because it gives them something to look forward to and still will allow them time to get their school work done at home. If the working school child wants to step much higher than he is, he will do his work and then his studies.\"",
