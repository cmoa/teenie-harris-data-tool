	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Madeline Greene, secretarial worker, of 818 Clarissa Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 17, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\"  Answer reads: \"I do think that because Mikoyan is from Russia we should not hold a grudge against him.  We should treat him the same way that we would want the Russians to treat us in a visit to their country.  Perhaps, if we treat him as a guest, when he returns to Russia he may.  I'm not saying that he will and report some things which previously the Russians thought were not true about our country.\"",
