Dickerson, chemical operator, Coraopolis and Mrs. Anna Watson, factory worker, Neville Island, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 21, 1962, pg. 6 with question: Do you think the Government should investigate Big Steel's hiking the price of steel?\" Mr. Joseph A. Dickerson's answer reads: \"I think they should.  It will be pretty rough if they don't.  They want a raise now and then after getting a raise will raise the price later, and this will cause the cost of living to rise.\"  Mrs. Anna Watson's Answer reads: \"I certainly do, because I think a hike in the price of steel is going to make it hard on everything, and put a lot of persons out of jobs...\"",
