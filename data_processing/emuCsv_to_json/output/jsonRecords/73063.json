Washington, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 14, 1962, pg. 17 with question: \"Do you think it is ethical or right for a doctor to go on 'strike' as a protest?\"  Mr. Smith's answer reads: \"No.  How will people he cared for?  It's a doctor's duty to tend those who are sick.\"  Mrs. Buccie's answer reads: \"No.  Definitely not.  It's against the oath they take when they become doctors.  It is a defection from their purpose.\"",
