A1 with question \"What is our country's most pressing domestic problem?\"  Mrs. Wilson's answer reads: \"There are quite a few pressing problems, but, among the foremost is providing more jobs to overcome the large number of unemployed people.\"  Mrs. James Grgurich's answer reads: \" \"Right now,\" the work situation is the most pressing of our problems.  In some way we have to provide steady work for a large number of people and higher wages.  Another problem, which is perhaps part of the other problem, is to halt the importation into this country of large numbers of foreign products which can be sold cheaper than similar ones we make here.\"",
