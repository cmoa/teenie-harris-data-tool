Though it probably will be minor to begin with, I only hope and pray that it doesn't turn into anything major.\"  Mr. Powell's answer reads: \"I think there's a possibility but I don't believe, just because there is a crisis at the present time, that there is a demand for war.  I think it can be solved without it.\"",
