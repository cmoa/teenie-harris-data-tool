	"CatDescriptText": "Edward Foote, furnace tender, 711 Cherokee Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 4, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that theatrical productions like 'The Green Pastures,' which 'take-off' on religions, should be presented as entertainment?\" answer reads: \"No, I do not think that such programs should be presented as entertainment. I'm objecting mainly to the time the play was presented and not so much to what was contained in it.  I think that 'Green Pastures' should have been presented on a Sunday afternoon for religious education.  About the only scene I did not like was the one concerning Noah's attempt to get more whiskey from the Lord.  If I recall correctly from the Bible, Noah did get drunk on the ark.  But how he got drunk should be left up to the imagination of the viewer and should not be any wild idea or ideas of a script writer.  All that should have been necessary was to bring out the fact that Noah did get drunk.\"",
