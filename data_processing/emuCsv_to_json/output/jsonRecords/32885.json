The bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William S. Austin of Pittsburgh's East End.  The groom is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Chapman, also of Pittsburgh.  The Rev. William Toomey, assistant pastor of the church, performed the ceremony.  For her marriage, the bride wore a floor-length gown of tissue taffeta, fashioned with a scalloped neckline, embroidered with lily-of-the-valley flowers of Irish lace, and with a Victorian waistline with bustles at the sides which ended in a chapel train.  Her waist-length veil fell from a half-hat of seed pearls and she carried a bouquet of white baby chrysanthemums.  Yvonne Moore of Aliquippa served as maid of honor.  Bridesmaids were: Ada Strong and Barbara Pollard of Pittsburgh.  Little Toni Pittman was flower girl.  William Mitchell served as best man, and Harry Parker and Joseph Reaves were ushers.  The bride's mother wore a green brocade two-piece, high-waisted suit, accented with a blue floral pattern.  Following the ceremony, a reception was held at the Green Hearthe [Hearth]...  The new Mrs. Chapman is a senior at Mount Mercy College.  She is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.  Her husband is a life underwriter for Provident Home Life Insurance Company.
