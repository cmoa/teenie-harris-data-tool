	"CatDescriptText": "Herbert Bean, businessman, Kirkpatrick and Centre, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Out column published in New Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 5, 1970, pg. 14 with question: What do you think of \"the Skybus and the Port Authority's Early Action Program?\" Answer reads: \"I think we could use the Skybus money for something more important.  Right now we need houses.  We have so many people who don't have houses, particularly in low and middle income groups.  In the Hill District many houses have been condemned and none have been built to replace them.  There are instances where two and three families live in four rooms.  This is where the money should be spent.\"",
