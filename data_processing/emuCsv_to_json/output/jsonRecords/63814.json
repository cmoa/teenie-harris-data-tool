A1 with question: \"Do you think children should be given 'allowances' (money)? If so, for what reason or reasons (just to have spending money or for chores done around the home, etc.)?  Do you think that it helps or hinders the development of the youngster?\" answer reads: \"Yes, definitely.  However, it should not be given for work done.  The kids should know what work there is to be done at the house and do it without any thought of compensation.  The allowance should be given to keep them from nagging.  The money will teach them budgeting.\"",
