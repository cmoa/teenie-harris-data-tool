	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Will Smith, musician, Webster Avenue and Mr. Raymond Gibson, barber, 2410 Webster Avenue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 28, 1962, pg. 11 with question: \"As a newspaper readser, what type of stories have the greatest appeal to you; In other words, which stories do you read first?\"  Mr. Smith's answer reads: \"I read the current and local news, then the sports, and then some editorials, but not all.  I'm interested now, particularly, in the news concerning the re-development of the Upper Hill, especially as to what is happening to the Negro and especially the Negro property owner.  They are not building homes for Negroes, but are doing so for whites.\"  Mr. Gibson's answer reads: \"I usuallly start with the headlines and work my way straight back to the sports. The editorials I read last.  Perhaps the one type which has the greatest appeal now is that concerning racial problems, then the space race, and then the economic situation, housing, and redevelopment.\"",
