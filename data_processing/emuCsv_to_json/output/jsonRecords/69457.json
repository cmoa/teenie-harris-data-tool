	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Mary Jane Solomon, PITT sophomore, Castle Shannon and Mr. Edward Scott, high school student, sophomore, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 7, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Admitting many factors cause juvenile delinquency, which one do you think is the major contributor to this increasing social illness?\" Miss Mary Jane Solomon's answer reads: \"It's the entire society--the instability of almost everybody in an age in which we become more or less objects rather than people, and, where we recognize our insignificance and the fact that we can be manipulated...I've decided on this because juvenile delinquency is found in the upper middle and middle class as well as in the lower economic class....The percentage is greater among the lower, possibly, because it feels the effects of our unstable society, much more strongly than the power elite...This means juvenile delinquency cannot be solved unless the whole society is changed....The solution, in my opinion, would come if the basic insecurity of society could be destroyed- totally and completely.\" Mr. Edward Scott's answer reads: \"Television programs-- the cowboys and westerns.  The kids sees what is going on and then go into the streets and try to do the fighting and the shooting they saw.  These horse operas are nothing but legend.  They're not history and are not giving an education.\"",
