	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Harlis Wilson, 12 Brereton Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 3, 1958, pg. 1A with question: \"Do you think that the average family spends too much time watching television programs? If so, how has it affected family life?\" answer reads: \"I think that some of them do.  They stay up all night and then when they go to work the following day, they feel badly.  Recently, I was in the hospital, and one of the attendants there told me that she spent a lot of time at night watching television and as a result was tired on the job.  As for young kids, they should be in bed at 10 P.M. each night, and not be permitted to watch television because this will affect their studies.\"",
