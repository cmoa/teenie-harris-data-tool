Crampton. Nicknamed \"Grampy\" by his friends, he has been dispensing drugs at 1403 Wylie avenue for the past 36 years. Mr. Crampton states, \"years of experience have taught me the value of capitalizing on the advertising campaigns that are run in papers which are read by my customers.\" The picture above showing the attractive Phillip Morris window display which Crampton had placed in his store, certainly confirms his statement. Standing beside Crampton is one of his clerks Samuel Golden, a second year student in the Duquesne school of pharmacy. - Harris Photo.\"",
