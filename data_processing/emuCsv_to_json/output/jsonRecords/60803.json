	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Robert Hardts, 3443 Webster Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 9, 1957, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you believe that licensed taverns are as harmful to a neighborhood as speakeasies and gambling joints? Why?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  Speakeasies and gambling joints in any neighborhood are detrimental to the neighborhood.  And they are an infringement on the tavern's rights, since they are illegally operated.  The kids see what is going on there in their community and therefore they get the idea that it is all right.  Before long, it breaks down the social and moral standards.\"",
