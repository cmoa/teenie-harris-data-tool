If they stayed at home and gave their children guidance and help with their education and over the rough spots in school.  I think there would be much less juvenile delinquency....\"  Anne Perry's answer reads: \"There's not enough of Christianity in the family back-grounds, and there's a need for better home training, in general.\"",
