	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Robert Fitzgerald, Richmore Drive, Verona, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 22, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should be 'militant' in their fight for civil rights or pursue a course of 'sitting down, talking and seeking a working plan for obtaining them without vigorous pressure?\"  Answer reads: \"I believe that they are entitled to all their rights the same as everybody else. If they go about obtaining them in a vigorous way, that is all right.  However, so far as actual and vigorous physical encounter, I say no.  The vigorous enforcement of the law on the basis of political organization is all right.  The ideal situation will take time, but it will be soon.\"",
