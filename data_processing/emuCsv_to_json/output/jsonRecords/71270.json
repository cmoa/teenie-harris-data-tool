A1 with question \"Do you believe there should be another Negro judge in the local state courts - Allegheny County Court and the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County?\"  Ms. Gray's answer reads: \"I certainly am in favor of it.  The number of cases handled by the number of judges makes them overworked and therefore another judge is needed.\"  Ms. Kelly's answer reads: \"Yes, I do. I don't think there are enough colored judges for the county.  There are a lot of Negro attorneys and I believe that by having more Negro judges this will help them out.\"",
