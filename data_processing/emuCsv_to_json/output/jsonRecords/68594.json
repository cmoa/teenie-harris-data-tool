	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Ella Davis, housekeeper, Garfield and Mr. James Washington, retired, 515 Brushton Ave., were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 14, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"In your opinion what political party has done the most for the Negroes?\" Mrs. Ella Davis' answer reads: \"I would say the Democrats.  During the Roosevelt administration, Negroes advanced more than they have in subsequent years.  And they were able to hold jobs previously denied them.\"  Mr. James Washington's answer reads: \"To be frank, in recent years the Democrats have done more.  Negroes have been able to hold better positions and better jobs than they did before.  And this holds true for the Democrats on both the national and local levels.\"",
