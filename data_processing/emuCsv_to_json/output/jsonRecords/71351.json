	"CatDescriptText": "Charles Ellis, \"lab\" assistant, Oakland, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 21, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that men should marry women within their own age bracket (not over fiver years difference) or do you approve of 'May and December' marriages?\" answer reads: \"Those between 22 and 27 who marry should be in the same age bracket. Persons in this age bracket seek out the mates who are compatible....I can't say anything about the 17 or 19-year-olds...I'm definitely against a 'May and December' marriage because it's quite obvious that the woman is marrying only for security, and vice-versa if it happens to be a younger man marrying an older woman.....Once the money is gone, in such a marriage, the mate is gone also.  A marriage like this eventually leads to separation...\"",
