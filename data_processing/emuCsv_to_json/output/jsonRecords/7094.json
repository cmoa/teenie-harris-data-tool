A popular vote brought her to victory.  A young Beachview [sic] matron won second prize at the recent Allegheny County Fair with her painting of the late President John F. Kennedy.  Attractive Mrs. Nedra Miller of 1554 Napoleon Ave., has only been painting since 1964.  Always attracted to the arts, Mrs. Miller ventured first to the Arts and Crafts Center on Fifth Avenue, and was fortunate enough to study under Mary Shaw Marhonic.  Later, she learned the fine art of copying pictures as portraits on velvet, and worked at this for a time in conjunction with a studio.  Mrs. Miller's portrait of Kennedy won second prize by popular vote at the Fair.  Some day, she says, she will return to Arts and Crafts Center for further study. Harris Photo.\"",
