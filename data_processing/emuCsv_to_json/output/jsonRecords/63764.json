	"CatDescriptText": "Lloyd L. Fisher, redcap, 3056 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 6, 1959, pg. 1 with question: \"Do you think that racial prejudice is inherent or is it taught to children? If you believe that it is taught do you think that the teaching of it is increasing or diminishing?  If so, by whom do you think that it is taught?\" answer reads: \"I think that when you really look at the situation, the children are taught by their parents.  Not all parents do this, but in some instances a child learns racial hatred from his associates, like children who did learn racial prejudice from his or her parents.  I think that it is decreasing here in Pittsburgh, and the reason is education.  People here are being convinced that iti's [sic] the man and not his color, race or religion or creed that counts.\"",
