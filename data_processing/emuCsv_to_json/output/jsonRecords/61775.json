	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. John Bolden, Earle Hotel, Seventh and Liberty Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 14, 1958, pg. 8 with question: \"Do you think ministers should invest in business enterprises for profit, or become executives or directors of such concern?\" answer reads: \"No, because if he takes care of his ecclesiastical duties, he will not have time to devote to anything else. In other words, if I spend six months taking care of my own business and six months leaving others business along, I will have no time for anything else.  This is the same way that i feel about the question.\"",
