Williams, 3629 Butler Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 18, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you think that refuse drivers and collectors should be tipped at Christmas time? Is service affected if they are not?\" answer reads: \"No, because I work for a big concern, the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., and they don't give me tips.  The refuse collector is getting a salary, so he's only doing his job.  I think it affects the services because I've seen where garbage would linger around for quite some time.  Eventually, the refuse collector would come back.  This was where I lived before, on Auburn St.  However, where I live now, I get good service.\"",
