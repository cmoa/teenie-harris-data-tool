	"CatDescriptText": "Henry McGuire, hotel owner, 304 Hawkins Avenue, North Braddock, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 30, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"The married woman with children makes the best teacher because she already has adapted herself, whereas for the single woman the lack of an understanding of children perhaps would lead to their getting on her nerves a lot quicker.  I think that it is all right for a man to teach elementary school because a man, more or less, can adapt himself to almost anything because he reasons and thinks differently than a woman.  Yes, he can gear himself to almost anything.\"",
