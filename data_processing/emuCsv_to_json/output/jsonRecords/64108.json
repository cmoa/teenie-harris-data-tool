A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower should invoke the Taft-Hartley Act in steel strike?\" answer reads: \"As much as I hate to say it, the use of the Taft-Hartley law seems to be the only alternative for the President, because it seems that union and management cannot bargain in good faith. But I would hate to see Government intervention, because, as things stand now, there already is too much intervention from Washington.\"",
