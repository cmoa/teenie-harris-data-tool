The way things are building up with this crisis, it's bound to happen.\"  Mrs. Johnston's answer reads: \"Yes, because the plant where my husband works has been shut down for sometime, probably for conversion.  It struck me as funny that they were opening it up again.  They did the same sort of thing before, and it turned out that it was to convert to war production.\"",
