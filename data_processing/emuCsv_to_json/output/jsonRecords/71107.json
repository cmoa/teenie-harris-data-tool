Berry, shipper, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 10, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"Do you read daily and weekly newspapers and magazines regularly?  Do you think they present the news, etc., fairly and objectively, or do you believe that they are influenced in their presentation? If you believe the latter, who or what do you think influences the presentation?\"  Rev. Knox's answer reads: \"I read both, and I would say that the news is slanted in favor of believers of the worn-out philosophies brought over from Europe.\"  Mr. Berry's answer reads: \"I believe they are influenced, but what it is, I don't know.  You have to read between the lines to find the truth.\"",
