In many communities, including Pittsburgh, they have their own annual social events and picnic to which they look forward each year.  Pittsburgh's annual 'Old Folks' Picnic' is such an event and needless to say the elderly people have a 'gay old time.'  On Tuesday, Aug. 4, 100 older persons composed of aged and shut-in members of Ebenezer Church, residents of the Lemington Avenue Home for Aged Women, and residents of the Aged Ministers' and Laymen's Home on Oakwood Street, journeyed again to the Farm House in Highland Park for their annual picnic.  The guests were picked up and brought to the park and retuned to their homes.  The annual 'Old Folks' Picnic' is sponsored by the James East Mission Society of the Ebenezer Baptist Church.  Mrs. Georgianna Fitzgerald is president of the group; Mrs. Gertrude Martin, vice president; Mrs. Lucy Holmes, chairman, and Dr. James B. Cayce, minister.\"",
