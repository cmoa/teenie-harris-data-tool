	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. George Thompson, 222 Seabolt Road, Library, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 27, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think there is any racial tension in Pittsburgh? in neighborhood where you live?  If so, what do you think causes it?\" answer reads: \"Sure, they do.  And I will give you a real good example.  It happened to my husband and I about two weeks ago when we were coming from Shawness State Park.  We were followed about two miles by state police who thought that I was white.  They gave us a bad time.  They finally stopped us and made my husband get out and they patted him down and told him to shut up.  Why they treated him just like a dog in the street.  We have taken the case to the Legal Division of the AAA.  The whole thing happened, because they thought I was white.  And another example, is that we just built a new house and have been in it only about two months.  We are the only Negroes there. And so far there hasn't been one person to come over and welcome us.  And my baby does not have anybody to play with.\"",
