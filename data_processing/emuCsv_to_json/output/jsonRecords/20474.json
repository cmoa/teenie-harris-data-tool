Andrew A. Hughey, and known to many present members and past members throughout the nation since its construction in 1906 at the corner of Elm Street and Wylie Avenue, is giving way to progress.\" Portions of accompanying article by George Barbour on p. 3, read: \"Word on Lower Hill: 'Say Goodbye Next Spring' Residents, Old Landmarks Must Bow to Progress - For every gain there's a loss and that's the gist of the story on the Lower Hill District redevelopment project.  Besides the many Third Ward homes, there also are other endeared friends of the residents, and the city in general.  They are the various institutions which in past have responded wholeheartedly to the needs of the scores of tenants in the area.  There's no cause for alarm, but starting next spring, 'goodbyes' will be in order for the historic landmarks and places many have known as 'home.'  Many months or even years may pass before the headache balls topple the last surviving landmark into a heap of masonry and twisted steel, but the machinery of Pittsburgh progress - the Urban Redevelopment Authority - is already being lubricated to swing into action.\" ... \"The official word is that by next spring, people and institutions will have to leave some of the sectors wile others may remain for as long as four years.\" ... \"The Lower Hill project, which is earmarked for a 1958 completion date will feature the Crosstown Boulevard, a civic arena, luxury-type apartments, and business establishments...\"Bethel AME Church was located at 1206 Wylie Avenue.",
