	"CatDescriptText": "Russell Green, poultry store employee, 42 Heldman Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"Newspapers play more important roles in influencing public opinion today than they did in the past.  Housing development is one example of the influence of the press.  The main reason for the projects is that newspapers, especially The Pittsburgh Courier, kept reporting about the housing hardships of people.  In some things, newspapers are not free to tell the truth, because of outside influences which prevent it.\"",
