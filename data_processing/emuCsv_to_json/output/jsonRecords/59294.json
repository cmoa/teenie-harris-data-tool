That's the date when members of the Youth Department of Centre Ave. YMCA will travel by special bus to Ohio for 'Operations Cleveland.'  The tourists will visit the Cedar Ave. Branch of YMCA, where they will swim and meet other youngsters.  The return trip will be made by way of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  Parents are welcome to come along on the trip, which will serve as a vacation for many youths.  Additional information may be obtained by calling the YMCA MA 1-1762.\"",
