If so, how has it affected you?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that it has hit too hard.  And most of the thanks can go to a guy named Roosevelt who set up the social security program.  Before when there were hard times, there wasn't anything coming in.  I work for the State and therefore have not been hurt by the hard time.\"",
