Enjoying the proceedings is Beverly Gallaher of 348 Amabell Street, Mount Washington, who had a hand in Junior Red Cross project.  Smiles likewise lit the faces of twenty other little ladies at such institutions and hospitals as the Queen Esther Home for Children and Leech Farm, when they received dresses like these. - Harris Photo.",
