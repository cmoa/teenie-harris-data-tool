	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Gus McDonough, hospital attendant, Beechview and Mr. Ernest Bruce, janitor, Fifth Ward were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 25, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be held responsible, to the extent of being arrested, and fined, or imprisoned, (like the responsibility for their children's attendance at school) for the delinquency practices of their respective teen-age children?\" Mr. Gus McDonough's answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  If they do for education why shouldn't they do it for delinquency, because delinquency is really neglect on the parents' side and they should be fined, because they are responsible.\"  Mr. Ernest Bruce's answer reads: \"No, I don't.  Parents can't be responsible for the children after they reach a certain age.  And I might add, that if you start a child out right, you won't have to worry about the child getting into trouble later on.\"",
