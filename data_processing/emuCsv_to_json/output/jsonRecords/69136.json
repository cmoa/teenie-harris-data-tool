A1 with question: \"Do you believe that labor unions, in general, are doing all they can to see that Negroes are not discriminated against in hiring and upgrading in employment?\"  Mrs. Croson's answer reads: It's improving, because things are better than they used to be.  But, still there is more which can be done.\"  Mr. Edison's answer reads: \"I wouldn't say that they are doing all that they can.  They really have given the colored man a break.
