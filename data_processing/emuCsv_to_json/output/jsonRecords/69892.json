Lebanon, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 2, 1960, pg. A1 question reads: Do you think religion will play a major part in the choosing of the presidential candidate? If so, why?\" Lane's answer reads: \"It shouldn't and I don't think it will.  People are pretty broad-minded, and they won't be concerned so much about religion as they will about how the candidate stands on other issues.\" Bauer's answer reads: \"I Hope not, but I think that it is bound to play a part.  The reason is there are too many prejudices-both concerning race and religion.\"",
