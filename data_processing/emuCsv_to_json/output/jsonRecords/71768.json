	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Celeste Nadeo, teacher, Brushton, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 5, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"If you were advising a Negro high school student, who plans to enter college and is seeking help on choosing a vocation, what field would you suggest that he or she seek as a vocation?\"  Education is a prime need, now, in this country, we need people who can become good teachers and outstanding scientists, today and tomorrow, because of the threat posed by Russia.  My advice, to a student, would be that science would be the first choice, if possible, but there are many fields in which one may be serviceable.\"",
