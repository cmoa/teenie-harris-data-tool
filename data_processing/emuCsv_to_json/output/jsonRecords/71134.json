	"CatDescriptText": "Mack Frierson, railroad worker, McKees Rocks and Fred Grauert, elevator operator, Mt. Oliver, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 10, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"Do you read daily and weekly newspapers and magazines regularly?  Do you think they present the news, etc., fairly and objectively, or do you believe that they are influenced in their presentation? If you believe the latter, who or what do you think influences the presentation?\"  Mr. Frierson's answer reads: \"I don't believe they present everything fairly. What you are has a lot to do with what is published.\"  Mr. Grauert's answer reads: \"The magazines I've seen.  I don't think they are completely fair and objective.  The newspapers are a little more authentic.  Perhaps what keeps them from being 100 per cent authentic is because the newspapers are printed so rapidly the reporter didn't do the job because he was in too big a hurry.\"",
