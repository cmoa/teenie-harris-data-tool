	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Arie White, steelworker, Fifth Ward and Mr. Bennie Adams, laborer, Wylie Avenue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 17, 1962, pg. A3 with question: \"Do you think Bible reading in public schools is constitutional or unconstitutional?\" Mr. Arie White's answer reads: \"I wouldn't say it's wrong.  It's constitutional.  In a way, I think it's all right to do that because there are a lot of people who live through life and they don't have a Bible.  You never know the benefits.  Perhaps Bible reading will save a person who just about is too far gone.\"  Mr. Bennie Adams' answer reads: \"I think it's constitutional because I feel that it's for religious purposes and a person have to have faith in something, and no better faith could be found than in the Bible.\"",
