	"CatDescriptText": "William Easley, 2028 Plainview Avenue, Brookline, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1 with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" answer reads: \"Well, thats the $64 question.  In answering the $64 question, I might say that they have got so many bosses that they don't know who's who.  I think that Murtaugh is being directed to and he does not have full control of the team.  I don't think he is using the best players.  He is now making a move to bench two of three players.  I say that this should have been done before.  For instance, Baker can play practically any position in infield.  I wonder why he is keeping him on the bench.  That is what I don't think that Murtaugh is in full control.\"",
