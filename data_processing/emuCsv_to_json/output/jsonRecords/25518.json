	"CatDescriptText": "Prince Bland was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Out column published in New Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 8, 1975, pg. A4. \"President Ford has previously revealed his plans to \"attempt\" to stabilize the economy by dealing with both inflation and recession. in event that the president's proposal which consists of a tax rebate and the rationing of gas is subsequently adopted by Congress the consumer will be forced to pay the man at the pumps an additional quarter.  Pittsburghers spoke out and expressed comparable desires to utilize \"some other type of transportation\"; rather than to spend their entire rebate and possibly some more on \"Black gold.\" \"  Answer reads: \"If the price of gas goes up another penny I'd either take the trolley or utilize the urban mass transit system because I don't believe in proposals such as skybus and an additional 30 cents for gas is too expensive.  I just won't drive at all if Ford's economic strategy is implemented.  I don't favor his proposal and you don't have time enough for me to tell you what I do favor, but I will some time young fellow.\"",
