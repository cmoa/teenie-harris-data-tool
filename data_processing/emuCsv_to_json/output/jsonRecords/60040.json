A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"I don't know about spending too much, but I might say that Ike knows just what he is doing.  As to whether or not what we have spent has halted the spread of communism, I say who knows what would have happened if we hadn't helped various ountries (sic].  If there had not been any foreign aid, there might be more countries under Communist control.\"",
