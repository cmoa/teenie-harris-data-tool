A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"No, I think that they are open long enough.  With the present hours, the people still have enough time to get into trouble, and still be ready to go to church in morning.  As for the sales on Sunday, it is all right if the taverns open up, after church services.\"",
