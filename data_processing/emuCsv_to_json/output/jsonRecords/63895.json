A1 with question: \"Do you think that 18-year-olds should be given the privilege of voting?\" answer reads: \"Yes. I would say that nowadays, kids of 18 years of age are more qualified to vote than those of a similar age 10 or 15 years ago.  At 18 years of age, an average youth, today, has the I.Q. that one of 21 had about 10 or 15 years ago.\"",
