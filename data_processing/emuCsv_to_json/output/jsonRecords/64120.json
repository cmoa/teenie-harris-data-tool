A1, with question: \"How do you think Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States affected relations between our country and Russia? Were you or were you not impressed by his visit to Pittsburgh?\" answer reads: \"I think the visit was a wonderful move and it would be wise for President Eisenhower to return the visit.  I think that the visit helped to resolve a lot of doubts, or rather I should say if the doubts are not completely resolved, they are partially resolved.  I was very much impressed by the reception which Pittsburghers gave him.\"",
