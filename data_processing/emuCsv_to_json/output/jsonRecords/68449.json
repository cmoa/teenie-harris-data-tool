	"CatDescriptText": "Catherine McCall, housewife, Ingram and Lucinda Pearson, housewife, West End, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, April 16, 1960, pg. A1 with question \"What role, if any, do you think the United States should play in the present South African situation?  Do you think United Nations' intervention is enough?\"  Mrs. McCall's answer reads: \"We need to clean up the problem here before we go abroad.  We have the same thing here in our South.  There's a need for stronger UN action.\"  Mrs. Pearson's answer reads: \"I do think so.  We should go to the rescue of the persecuted people there, because we are supposed to be the most intelligent nation.  However I think that the members of the United Nations should first straighten out their problems before they take any action.\"",
