Does he have any power? Does he exert his power?\" Mrs. McCray's answer reads: \"Yes, I know the ward chairman who is Tony Upsher.  As far as I'm concerned, he does have power and to my knowledge he does exert that power.  he does just as much as he can for Negroes.\"  Mrs. White's answer reads: \"Mr. Tony Upsher is my ward chairman.  As to whether or not he has any power, I might say that Tony has just become ward chairman.  He's very intelligent and is doing his best to get things done.\"",
