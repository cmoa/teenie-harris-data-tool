	"CatDescriptText": "Agnes Mazik, housewife, North Braddock and Don Fahrner, salesman, Knoxville, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 2, 1960, pg. 25 with question \"What is your opinion of the service rendered by the Pittsburgh Railways Company?  Do you think trolley fare rates should be increased?\"  Mrs. Mazik's answer reads: \"The bus service from where I live is much better than the trolley service. After taking a bus to Swissvale, I have to wait about one-half hour there for a 64 trolley.  As for the increase in fares, for us shoppers it would not be too bad,  but a person who has to come to town every day, well, it would be a little too much.  I'm thinking of person's like salesgirls.\"  Mr. Fahrner's answer reads: \"Pretty good.  The transportation is excellent from the Knoxville area into Pittsburgh.\"",
