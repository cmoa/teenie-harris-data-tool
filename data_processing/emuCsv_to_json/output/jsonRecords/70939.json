	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Gladys Jones, housewife, Hill District and Mr. Ernest Hefney, HIll District, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 2, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \" Do you think police could wipe out all the rackets if they launched an intense, earnest campaign against vice and crime?\"  Mrs. Jones' answer reads: \"I don't think they'd do too much.  If they would, it would be a wonder.  They could probably get some of those involved, but not all of them.\"  Mr. Hefney's answer reads: \"Yes, I think it would be possible, but they are so busy taking care of little insignificant things that they let the big ones slide.  There are so many things that the police just don't take care of properly.\"",
