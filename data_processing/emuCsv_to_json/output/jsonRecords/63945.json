B1 with question: \"Do you believe judges give society proper protection by refusing to send confessed murderers, guilty of murder in the first degree, to the electric chair?\" Rachel Carlucci's answer reads: \"No, not all the time. There are some cases where the murderer should be sentenced to the electric chair.  That way, the public is better protected from the menace.  If he's really dangerous, it is best for people that he be out of the way.\"  Lilia Comer's answer reads: \"I feel that perhaps there should be some kind of an examination of the mind to find out whether or not the person is stable, that is, whether or not he will commit it again.  If the crime resulted from anger, I think that he should have life in prison.  However, if the murderer is truly of a criminal mind, I think that he deserves the electric chair.\"",
