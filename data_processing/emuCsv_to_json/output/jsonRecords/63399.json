	"CatDescriptText": "Harvey Chandler, 2341 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 14, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the recreational facilities for young people in Pittsburgh are adequate? If not, what do you think should be done about it?\" answer reads: \"I do not.  We do not have adequate facilities for the children to enjoy sports like baseball and football.  I think that the city should provide for the facilities so that the youngsters will have a place to go and will keep them off the streets.  There is a tax for everything else, therefore, there might as well be a tax for recreation for youth.\"",
