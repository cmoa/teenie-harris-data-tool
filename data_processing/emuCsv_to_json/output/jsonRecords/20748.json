Va., the third annual coronation dances of The Pittsburgh Courier, under the sponsorship of the top dance promoters in chosen sections, captured the attention of many thousand dance and music lovers. At each stop Count Basie and his men of syncopation were lauded for their great musical ability and talent which stood them in good stead, winning for them two of the paper's annual band concerts...  In the last photo, Basie and all the boys in the band pause for a taste of Pabst Blue ribbon beer, product of the company which donated the superb trophies honoring him and his men.  These scenes were taken in Kansas City, St. Louis, Akron, and Wheeling.\"",
