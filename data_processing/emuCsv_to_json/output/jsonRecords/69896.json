	"CatDescriptText": "Harry Azen, newsdealer, Troy Hill and Frank Arlott, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 11, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that forcing teen-aged children to reply, 'Yes, sir,' or 'No, sir,' 'Yes, mam,' and 'No, mam,' to their inquiring elders makes them 'subservient and docile,' thus lacking the courage to 'stand up for the convictions'?\" Harry Azen's answer reads: \"I don't see where there's anything wrong with it.  I think it is more mannerly and is the proper way.\"  Frank Arlott's answer reads: \"No, they ought to say 'Yes, sir', and \"No, sir'.  They are younger than the others and therefore they should have and show respect.\"",
