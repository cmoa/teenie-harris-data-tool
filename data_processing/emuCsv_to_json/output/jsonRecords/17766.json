The GPIL has also secured clerk-cashier jobs for Negroes at several other chain stores throughout the city, including the Thorofare Supermarket at the intersections of Lincoln Avenue, Frankstown Avenue and Lowell Street in East Liberty.  In the left picture, Miss Helen Smith, one of the cashiers at the new Donahoe store, the front of which is shown in the second photo, waits on an anonymous white customer, one of the many thousands she serves during the day.  In the right picture, another clerk, Jamer Hill, receives instructions from Mr. Donahoe, manager of the store, and a relative of the owners of the chain, as to the amount of stock needed, the specials for the day, and other matters Mr. Hill will need to know in waiting on trade.\"",
