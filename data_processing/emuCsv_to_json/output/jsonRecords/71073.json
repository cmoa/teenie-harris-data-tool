A1 with question \"What is our country's most pressing domestic problem?\"  Mr. Wargo's answer reads: \"Education is not the greatest, but one of the most pressing at this time, because of the fall beginning of school...It is our American ideal to give everybody an education...But the question now is, are we doing this?  Is everybody getting just what they deserve in the education system because they are Americans?\"  Mr.Kavanagh's answer reads: \"Hatred and bigotry today make the country's biggest problem which is disunity.  The persecutions of such groups as the Negro, Roman Catholics and the Spanish population in New York City, greatly divide our country...All should act together as brothers and put an end to the hatred and bigotry...\"",
