	"CatDescriptText": "Max Wolfson, salesman, Penn Hills and John Dinkins, Fifth Ward, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 4, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the names of juveniles who commit felonies, as distinguished from misdemeanors, should be published in the newspapers?\"  Max Wolfson's answer reads: \"I don't believe that names of juveniles should be published in the newspapers, because it creates a black mark on the person by establishing a permanent record for the entire community to see, whereas the reason behind the commission of the crime, I feel, should be investigated privately and any possibility of correction for the individual should not be for public notice.\"  John Dinkins' answer reads: \"I don't think that they should be published because juveniles do things without thinking and it should not reflect on the person's whole family like it does when the names are published.\"",
