A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  I think that they have the same opinion of Africa as they do the American Negro.  And that attitude is towards looking down at the Negro as being inferior.  I don't think that there is sufficient knowledge about Africa here in this country.\"",
