	"CatDescriptText": "J.I. Hammitt, Methodist religious worker, McKeesport, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\"  Answer reads: \"It seems mainly a matter of education.  And we should do all that we can to enforce the laws which we now have, because there are some persons who will not treat others like human beings until they are convinced that the law stands.\"",
