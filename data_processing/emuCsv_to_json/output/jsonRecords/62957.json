A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"Not generally. I, myself, worked after school.  In my opinion the case depends on the individual, and can not be answered with a general statement.  As fro the age I would say that those kids between 13 and 14 years of age, or from Junior High School up, should be permitted to work, if they are of the type who can work and still maintain their studies.\"",
