Cordice, shown in his backyard, said he fired a shotgun from the vicinity of the read porch (arrow) to scare the \"young devils\" who disturbed his Saturday's peace at home. The Rev. A.M. Waller, whose home is to the right, said that the frequent disturbances to Negro new home owners which resulted in the hospitalization of a 13-year-old white boy with four pellets in his body, perhaps can be traced partly to his property purchase and subsequent building which blocked the unauthorized opening of the alley (indicated by dotted lines) along which many white families live. - Harris Photo.\"",
