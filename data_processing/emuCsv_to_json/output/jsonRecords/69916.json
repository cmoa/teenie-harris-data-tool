	"CatDescriptText": "Donald Glanton, East End and Bertha Mahaffey, domestic, Rochester, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 18, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you believe that Patrice Lumumba, deposed Premier, was a good or evil influence on the Congo, in his quest for the natives to rule themselves?  Do you believe his slaying was justified?\"  Mr. Glanton's answer reads: \"I think that evidently he was a good influence.  he had to be, because he was a leader of the people up until the time they got their freedom and the UN came in.  I don't think the slaying was justified.  He should have had a trial and the United Nations should have interceded in order to make certain that he was protected until the time he could have been put on trial.\"  Mrs. Mahaffey's answer reads: \"I really have not read enough to voice an opinion.  However, I think that we don't understand what they do.  They are not as civilized as we are and, therefore, maybe what they did they considered all right.  However, according to the Bible, and our beliefs, it was not right.\"",
