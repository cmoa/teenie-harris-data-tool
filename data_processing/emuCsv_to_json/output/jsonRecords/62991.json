	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Donald Russell, steelworker, 2255 Bloomer Way, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 8, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Which of these sources of leadership do you believe Negroes generally follow: church, labor, or politics? Why?\" answer reads: \"I would say that labor and political leadership are tied when it comes to the question of which Negroes follow the most.  You have to follow labor because you have to work for a living.  And  you have to follow politics in order to get the job to work.  I don't necessarily mean a political job, but I mean jobs that result from putting the right man into office.  I like to go to church, but we can go to church as much as we want, but we won't get anything to eat because they won't feed you.  In fact, you have to give up something.  With a good job I can live up to my church obligations.\"",
