A1 with question: \"Do you think that high school students should strike in order to air grievances or to gain their objectives?\"  Answer reads: \"No, I don't think so. The reason is that if you are after a higher education, you are not going to go out on strike.  If you are in college, certainly you are not going to strike against your professors, so therefore high school students should not strike against the high school teachers.\"",
