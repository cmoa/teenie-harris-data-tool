	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Theodore Lampkin, 6332 Station Street, East Liberty, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"Yes, the congregation should pay him a cost-of-living salary because he has to live the same as anybody else. If he's getting a decent salary, he should pay his rent.  He should get a paid vacation because he is working the same as you and I.  On certain occasions, he should have special gratuity days to give him money to travel to conventions and meetings of ministers.\"",
