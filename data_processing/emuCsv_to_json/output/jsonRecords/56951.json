Most of the persons testified that they at one time had been registered in the precinct, but did not vote in the 1952 presidential and congressional election which led to the indictments of the board members and New Kensington racketeer Frankie Phillips.  When confronted with their signatures on ballot certificates which showed that a vote had been cast in their name, they replied that the signatures were false.  The Rev. Solomon Cooper, now of Zanesville, Ohio, and who was pastoring in Canonsburg in 1952, and did not vote, is pictured on the extreme left of the picture.  Mrs. Betty Anne Jarnagin of New Kensington and Mrs. Gladys Fishman Williams, now of Portsmouth, Ohio, are the fourth and last persons pictured on the extreme right of the photo. - Harris Photo.\"",
