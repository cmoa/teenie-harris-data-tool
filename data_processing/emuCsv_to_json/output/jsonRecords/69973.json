Haering Jr., record salesman, Monroeville Heights and Mrs. Anna Mae Good, housewife, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 25, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be held responsible, to the extent of being arrested, and fined, or imprisoned, (like the responsibility for their children's attendance at school) for the delinquency practices of their respective teen-age children?\" Mr. David G.R. Haering Jr.'s answer reads: \"If the teen-agers are doing something wrong, while their parents have knowledge of the wrong-doings, I say, yes, the parents should be arrested and fined or imprisoned.  But if the parents don't know about the wrong-doing, it's not their fault.  But, I might add, parents should know what their teen-aged daughter or son is doing.\"  Mrs. Anna Mae Good's answer reads: \"I don't think parents should be arrested and fined or put in jail.  It would be better if the kids were punished, and in that way, there wouldn't be a next time for a similar wrong-doing.\"",
