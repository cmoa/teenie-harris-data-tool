	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Shirley McMillian, Wilkinsburg, and Peggy Barkley, Wilkinsburg, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 24, 1962, pg. 8, with question: \"Do you think Pittsburgh Negroes are justified in being angry at the failure of city officials to appoint a Negro as police inspector, in spite of repeated appeals to grant them representation at this level of law enforcement?\" Ms. McMillian's answer reads: \"No. They ought to learn to vote as a body. What are our Negro politicians doing anyway?  All the Negroes in office have been appointed by white people.  They haven't stood up for us, as they should.  But, I would like to see us get a Negro police inspector, though.\"  Ms. Barkley's answer reads: \"I don't think they should be angry.  They should do something about it.  They just sit back too much.\"According to the Barkley family, Shirley McMillian was a nurse, and Peggy Barkley was a nurse at Western Psychiatric Institute. Barkley later married Hill District grocer and police officer John V. Hicks.",
