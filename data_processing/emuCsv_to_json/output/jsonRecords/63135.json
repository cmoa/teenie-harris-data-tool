	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. James Barnett, carhouse shifter, 3259 Arlington Avenue was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 28, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse, or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\" answer reads: \"I think that the morals in this community, or in any other community, can be as high as those in the past.  Man has degraded himself to such an extent that he is devoid of any morals.  By that I mean that when he leaves God out of the important things of life, he can do nothing else except go down hill in his moral standards.  The integrity of man has been greatly degraded in the eyes of God.\"",
