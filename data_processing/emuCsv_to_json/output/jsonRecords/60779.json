A1 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be imprisoned for the unlawful acts of their children (under 18 years of age)?\" answer reads: \"Frankly speaking, I don't think so. Children should be responsible for themselves at the age of 18.  Up to the age of 15, they are the parents' responsibilities and the parents should stand for them and discipline them.  They should be ordered to do so, if necessary, by some agency like the Juvenile Court.  If the parents still don't or can't discipline the child, the child should be taken out of their hands because they're not fit to be parents.\"",
