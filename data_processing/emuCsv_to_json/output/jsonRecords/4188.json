George M. Leader, candidate for the U.S. Senate, and Mayor David L. Lawrence, who is running for Governor of Pennsylvania, exchange compliments. Ms. Leader rocked the ballroom when he said: 'Mayor Lawrence is the best qualified man ever to run for Governor.' And the Mayor rocked 'em right back with the promise: 'And with your help I know we can achieve great victory. I KNOW that I am going to win.' Left to right: Toastmaster and chairman, Thomas E. Barrett, clerk of courts, Allegheny County; Mayor Lawrence, inspecting the 466-page program, which brought in almost $50,000 in ads for the party's campaign chest; the Hon.
