James T. Wiley of Pittsburgh, Pa., was the center of attraction in his hometown last week, when 50,000 citizens turned out to give him a rousing celebration.  The 25-year-old officer-pilot, wearing the Air Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster is back from Italy, where he flew 101 missions with the 99th Pursuit Squadron.  Included in the celebration was a colorful parade and an open-air program.  A $500 War Bond was given Captain Wiley by Mrs. Robert L. Vann, for The Pittsburgh Courier and friends.  One of the features of the parade was the appearance of a detachment of soldiers, shown in the scene at left, from Camp Reynolds, Pa., In photo at right, Captain Wiley, center, is congratulated by Mayor Cornelius Scully, as Maj.
