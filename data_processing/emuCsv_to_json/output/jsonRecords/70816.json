It helps break up this segregation when they make a stand against it.\"  Mr. Furio's answer reads: \"It's up to the team to make certain that everyone is treated fairly.  All should have the same advantages, especially in sports.  No one should make it uncomfortable for the colored players.  They are entitled to make an honest living like everyone else.\"",
