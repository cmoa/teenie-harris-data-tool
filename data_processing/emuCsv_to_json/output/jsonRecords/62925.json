	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Jimmy Wilson, 531 E. Ohio Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 18, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should immediately enforce the Supreme Court's recent decision in 'Little Rock School Case' or permit the recalcitrant states to take their time in obeying?\" answer reads: \"I think that Arkansas and the South should be like any other state and made to obey the Constitution. People are people.  We all are of the same race.  At present I'm going with a colored girl and I don't care what any of the people I grew up with in the South care about it.  I think that the Federal Government should step in and enforce the Supreme Court ruling even if we have to have another civil war or race riot.  I came to Pittsburgh about six years ago, and I might say that I can trust the Negro race better than my own.\"",
