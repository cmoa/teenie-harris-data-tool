Jefferson Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 9, 1957, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you believe that licensed taverns are as harmful to a neighborhood as speakeasies and gambling joints? Why?\" answer reads: \"No, a licensed place keeps better hours, whereas in speakeasies, anybody or everybody can go in, and especially youngsters, at all hours of the night.  If the place is licensed then there are certain hours and certain rules that have to be kept in order for the place to keep the license.\"",
