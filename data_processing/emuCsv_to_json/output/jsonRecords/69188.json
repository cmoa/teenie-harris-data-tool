A1 with question: \"Do you believe in the old-fashioned \"woodshed\" reprimand or the \"talking things over with the offender\" type of discipline as regards the correction of youngsters guilty of misdemeanors?\" Mrs. Foster's answer reads: \"Talking is better...When kids are talked to and things are explained it is a lot better...With a beating they become stubborn.\"  Mrs. Doeerzbacher's answer reads: \"Talking is much better.  It makes the child feel more grown up and gives him a greater sense of responsibility.\"",
