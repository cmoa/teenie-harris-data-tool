In a complaint to the County Health Department, it was identified as \"an oversized shed.\"  The owner maintains that he has city approval for the occupancy of the building.  The occupants have common kitchens, laundries and baths, similar to this one which was soundly criticized as way below health standards by County Health Inspector Jolin Katsur.  In checking conditions there, Inspector Katsur apparently in broken-record fashion, repeated several violations, among which were \"Improper flue,\" which he also used for this gas heater in a bathroom which was thoroughly condemned as sub-standard. - Harris Photo.\"",
