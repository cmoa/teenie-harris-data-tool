	"CatDescriptText": "Florence Robinson, Whitsett, Pa., near Perryopolis, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1 with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" answer reads: \"I\"m a San Francisco Giant fan.  However, as for the Pirates, I think that they have made quite an improvement.  There are a lot of wasted players on the bench.  They could use the colored player on first base.  And there is Powers and also some other guys who deserve a bigger break than they are getting now.\"",
