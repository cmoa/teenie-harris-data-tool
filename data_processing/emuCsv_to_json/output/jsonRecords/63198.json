	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Geraldine Bell, beautician, 242 Burrows Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 28, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think the morals of the community are better than they used to be, worse or about the same? If there is any change, what do you think caused it?\" answer reads: \"I think that they are much better than they used to be.  And the reason seems to be because people are better educated and therefore think wisely in their relations with their neighbors and others.  People are more worldly today, and the standard of living is much higher.\"",
