	"CatDescriptText": "Clarence L. Hall, department store employee, 828 Bryn Mawr Road, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\" Answer reads: \"Frankly speaking, I think that the President should be pressed on the issue of civil rights to all.  And because he does not have a lot of time in which to hold office, I think that greater pressure is needed now to insure greater success in the future.  There should be a law passed by Congress at the insistence of the President himself to make people realize just what the law of the land is regarding the fair treatment of all citizens.\"",
