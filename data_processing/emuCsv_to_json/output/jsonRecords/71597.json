Byrd Brown, president of the local branch, a pledge for $4,500, which eventually will entitle each of the nine members to a life membership. This puts the group in a class by itself, because most organizations take out only a single $500 membership.  Left to right, seated: Gladys Brown and Martha Loper.  Standing: Gladys Lawson, Emily Brisett, Ida Jones, president; Attorney Brown, Clozelle Peterson and Florence Hutchison. - Harris Photo",
