The brilliant baritone artist, obviously happy at the response, sang with warmth, power, and almost perfect pitch and gave a masterful recitative performance of the 'Death Scene' from 'Othello.'  The valiant warrior received a standing ovation from the audience when he appeared on the rostrum. - Harris photo.\"",
