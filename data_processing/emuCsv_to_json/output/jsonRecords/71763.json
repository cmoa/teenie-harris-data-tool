	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. John Smart, laborer, Euclid Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 5, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"If you were advising a Negro high school student, who plans to enter college and is seeking help on choosing a vocation, what field would you suggest that he or she seek as a vocation?\" Answer reads: \"Nothing is more important to us, as people, than our health.  Health is first.  Under that condition, which we recognize, without argument, there is nothing more important for a young student to attempt than a study of medicine.  People are more sickly than we realize, so we need men and women who know what to do for our ills.  Yes, I place medicine out front, as a most important vocation, for our students.\"",
