	"CatDescriptText": "George Ryan, serviceman, Overbrook Blvd., was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 11, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in the schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\" answer reads: \"I went to Connelley Trade School and I don't know if I would do it again.  Yes, I received a good trade, but I can't get good work because I can't become a member of the union of my trade.  If I had known, through counseling, that this would be the case, I probably never would have gone to the school.  Perhaps a counseling service, in some way, can help others like me to get into the union of their skills before the student graduates.\"",
