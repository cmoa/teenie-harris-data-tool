Is service affected if they are not?\" T.H. Banks' answer reads: \"I don't see any harm.  I always do.  I don't think that the service will be affected if the collectors do or do not receive tips.\"  Honey Hunt's answer reads: \"I think that is all right at Christmas time, but not every time they collect rubbish.  Regardless of whether they get a tip or not you should still get service.\"",
