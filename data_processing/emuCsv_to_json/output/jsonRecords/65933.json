	"CatDescriptText": "Bernard Carter, 3456 Webster Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 12, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Should well-defined courses in sex education be taught in public school system? If so, at what grade should the teaching of these courses begin?\" answer reads: \"We were taught some of the subject in biology in the ninth grade.  So far as a separate course on sex education, I strongly believe that there should be one and this should begin in the junior year of high school.  The reason it should be taught is because there are so many who are blind to the subject.\"",
