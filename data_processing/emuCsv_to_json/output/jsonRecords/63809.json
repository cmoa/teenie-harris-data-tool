A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"I think they should, because Saturday night is the time in which the businessman make their best profits.  It seems to me that if the taverns are not open on Sunday, the people, if they want to drink are going to find it somewhere.\"",
