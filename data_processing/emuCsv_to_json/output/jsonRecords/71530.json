Davis, porter, Robinson Township and Mr. William Singleton, hotel worker, East Liberty, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 18, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Negroes in Pittsburgh are as progressive as those in other metropolitan cities like New Your, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles? Why?\"   Mr. Davis' answer reads: \"I believe Negroes are doing better in Chicago, Detroit, and other cities, because they hire Negroes in more jobs in those cities than here.  As a result, Negroes progress much faster...\"  Mr. Singleton's answer reads: \"No, I don't, because here, Negroes don't have good jobs mainly because of discrimination.\"",
