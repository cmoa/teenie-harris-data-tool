Otterson, insurance man, Bellvue, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, May 19, 1962, pg. 9 with question: \"Do you think that, eventually, the City of Pittsburgh will come to include the outlying suburbs under a metropolitan plan of government?\"  Mrs. Ozechoski's answer reads: \"I don't know too much about Pittsburgh, but I think this will happen.  It would be a good thing.\"  Mr. Otterson's answer reads: \"With 129 municipalities in this country it's difficult to think of people coming into Pittsburgh to word eight hours and then returning to some other city to be faced with its problems.  I think it's more likely that the county will absorb parts of the city.  Sewage, libraries, some of the sanitation services are already under county supervision.  It's bound to happen.  It's not a matter of \"If.\"",
