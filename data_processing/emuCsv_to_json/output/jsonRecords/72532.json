Walton, postal clerk, Homewood and Mr. James Glascoe, custodial worker, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 17, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"What's wrong with the Republican party in Allegheny County?\" Mr. Edward A. Walton's answer reads: \"For one thing, they don't seem to be as aggressive as the Democrats are getting out the vote.  The Democrats have a strong hold on the city, but in my opinion, it doesn't have to be if the Republicans just put forth a little more effort.\"  Mr. James Glacoe's answer reads: \"I don't know because the Democrats seemingly have everything.  And I'm satisfied with the Democrats and the main reason is because I have a job under them.\"",
