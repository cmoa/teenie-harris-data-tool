	"CatDescriptText": "Dr. Lester A. Bumpus, executive secretary of the Pittsburgh Baptist Association, 520 Investment Bldg., was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 22, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the visit of the Russian ruler, Khrushchev, will promote world peace?\" answer reads: \"I wouldn't go so far as to say that it will promote peace. I hope that it will bring about a better understanding by people being good Christians like they should be.  By that I don't intend to say that we should convert the Russians, because in this world you have to deal with Christians and non-Christians.  As a Baptist minister, I stick to the concept that the best thing for the world is Christianity, but in a practical sense, I know that you have to deal with the non-Christian world.\"",
