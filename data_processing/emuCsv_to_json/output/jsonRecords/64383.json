	"CatDescriptText": "Helen Green, housewife, Bedford Dwellings and Atty. Perry Landis, attorney, Shadyside, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 2, 1960, pg. 25 with question \"What is your opinion of the service rendered by the Pittsburgh Railways Company?  Do you think trolley fare rates should be increased?\"  Mrs. Green's answer reads: \"Very poor on the 85.  And if it rains or snows, you'll never see them.  No raise is justified with the service as it now is.\"  Mrs. Landis' answer reads: \"Rather poor in general.  As of whether or not it is the company's fault, I don't know.  However, it's difficult for a city to run an outdated system.  We have no system for rapid transit here in Pittsburgh.  I don't know about the financial set-up so therefore I can't say whether or not a fare increase is justified.  I feel mass transportation is important enough to be subsidized.\"",
