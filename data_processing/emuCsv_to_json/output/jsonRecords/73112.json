If Earl Francis and Joe Gibbon come through for them, they'll finish all right.  It depends on their arms.  The reason why the Dodgers are doing so well is because they have good pitching, even if they lack something on the hitting side.\"  Mr. Jackson's answer reads: \"No time.  They're going to end up in the second division where they belong.  Los Angeles will take the pennant.\"",
