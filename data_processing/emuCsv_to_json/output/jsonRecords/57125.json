John Bronson, janitor at the apartments, escaped a possible death by a few seconds.  Bronson was bringing rubbish from the house to place in a disposal located where the slide is pictured when he heard a 'rumbling noise which sounded like and earthquake and shook the building.'  The slide dented the side of the building as pictured. - Harris Photo.\"",
