B1 with question: \"At what age should young folks be allowed to have unchaperoned parties?\" Harry Maybury's answer reads: \"If the parents are in the house, I would say between the ages of 12 and 17.  At the other ages, the kids are wilder.  Actually they are not stable until around 25.\"  Eva Smith's answer reads: \"Around 16 or 17 years of age.  I think they can take care of themselves better at that age than when younger.\"",
