Jackson, 723 Fulton Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 1, 1958, pg. 9 with question: \"Do you believe in corporal (paddling) punishment for students, in the elementary grades, who misbehave? If so, who should mete [sic]  out the punishment-- the teacher or the principal?\" answer reads: �I believe in paddling.  I think that the principal should mete out the punishment.  Paddling is the best way to correct children and to let them know they are doing wrong.�",
