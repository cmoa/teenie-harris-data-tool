	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Nan Cargo, 1215 Lincoln Avenue, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 11, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"I have never been in favor of a school child working after school hours at a job away from home. For one thing, there seems to me to be enough work around home, which parents can make their children do and therefore make better kids out of them.  And then an outside job also would interfere with their homework for school.  As for a female, she encounters too much danger on the streets, and therefore it creates too much worry on the parents and especially if she is 10 minutes or so late.  Also, even the boys may encounter trouble on the street by stopping and becoming a part of the wrong crowd.\"",
