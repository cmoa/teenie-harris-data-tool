	"CatDescriptText": "David Crozier, student, Squirrel Hill and William O'Donnell, student, Castle Shannon, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, February 4, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the names of juveniles who commit felonies, as distinguished from misdemeanors, should be published in the newspapers?\"  David Crozier's answer reads: \"I think that what should be done is a study of the effect that the publishing of names has on juveniles.  This study should be conducted by a competent psychologist.  If it reveals that it would help the youngsters by keeping his name from the paper, well, than I'm all in favor of it.\"  William O'Donnell's answer reads: \"I don't think they should be published, because a lot of kids commit crimes just to get their names in the paper.\"",
