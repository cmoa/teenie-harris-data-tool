The merchants say that despite their pleas to the City Complaint Bureau, police, fire and health authorities, nothing has been done about the nuisance, except to put out the fires which are started frequently to chase the vagrants, winos and loafers who hang around it.  Merchants say private rubbish haulers unload their trucks on this lot, then burn surplus refuse so that they can selvage metal parts and other items for sale as junk.  The nuisance has persisted all winter. - Harris Photo.\"",
