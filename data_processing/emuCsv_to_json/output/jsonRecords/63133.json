A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so. I do not think that they want anything to happen here similar to the Chicago fire disaster.  The taxpayers, I believe, want their children to be safe, and therefore they would not oppose an increase in taxes to have better schools.\"",
