Left to right, crooning Boots Swann, whose melodious voice has been a treat to nitelifers for many years; Turner and Burrelle, dancers extraordinaire; Myrtle Wilson, hipologist and charm dancer; 'Detroit Red' herself, full of pep, swing and a million jokes; Dewey Taylor, who is an artist on the mouth organ; pretty Froshine Stewart, soloist with the Sunset Royals...the supporting band for this marvelous layout.  The band is led by Little Genevieve...a maestro if there ever was one.  Gus Greenlee is the manager of the Casino.\"",
