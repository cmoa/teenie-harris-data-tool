	"CatDescriptText": "Jack Tuff, college student, 2225 Wylie Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 21, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that taxpayers would oppose a raise in taxes to build new schools and to repair old ones which may be or might soon become fire traps?\" answer reads: \"I don't think so. I think that most people will see that the hazard is much worse than increased taxation.  I don't think that they will disapprove as they did in the past, if the Government makes a good effort to present the seriousness of the school situation.  If anything does happen, like a fire or some other tragedy, the people are going to hold the Government responsible.  Therefore, the people should must be prepared to pay for the safety of the children.\"",
