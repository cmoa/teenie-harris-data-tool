	"CatDescriptText": "Louis Coles, 2558 Centre Avenue and Joseph Powell, 2816 Perry Street, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 5, 1957, pg. 2 with question: \"Should ministers take an active part in politics? Do you believe that they should hold public office?\" Louis Coles' answer reads: \"No, I don't think so because the difference in the fields of politics and religion is so great.  If a minister gets into politics he probably will get away from religion.  That's mainly because religion teaches you to love your neighbor, but in politics, there is no way in the world in which you can love your neighbor if you have to run against him for political office.\"  Joseph Powell's answer reads: \"No, I don't think ministers should take an active part in politics.  They are supposed to take care of the church and not politics.  Ministers have no business monkeying around in that field.\"",
