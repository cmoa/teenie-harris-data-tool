At left is outfielder - first baseman Donn Clendenon, who will take over in left field if Bob Skinner flunks out again...  No rookie figured in Tuesday's opening day, 6-0 scuttling of the Phillies, but Veale was named to start the second game.  Only very impressive rookies get early calls of that sort,\"",
