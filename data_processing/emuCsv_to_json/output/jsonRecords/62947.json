A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that it is any harm for a child to work after school if the job is not too rough. The ideal jobs would be like delivering papers, and babysitting, and the like.  I think that it's good for the children to work because most kids want money of their own outside of what their parents give them.  Also, it aids them to become self sufficient, by teaching them how to earn money for themselves.\"",
