	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Richard Halka, new Army recruit, Whitaker and Mrs. Lucille Wortham, housewife, Schenley Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 21, 1962, pg. 17 with question: \"Do you approve of the United States testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere?\"   Mr. Halka's answer reads: \"I believe it should be tested, and more can be studied about it in the atmosphere.  We have to keep up with Russia.  As long as Russia does it, we should too.\"  Mrs. Wortham's answer reads: \"If it's a must, it has to be done.  We can only learn by doing.  There may be some danger to health because of the fallout, but a survey should be taken of conditions in areas where there has been considerable fallout and a comparison should be made in areas where there has not been any.  Then we would know if such a danger really exists.\"",
