He's above that sort of thing.\"  Mrs. Stuckeman's answer reads: \"No, it isn't fair to his patients.\"  Ms. Fleming's answer reads: \"No.  Their job is supposed to be part of their life.  People would die.\"  Ms. Maxwell's answer reads: \"No.  A lot of responsibility is placed on them.  People's lives are at stake.  It's against the oath they take.\"",
