A1 with question: \"Do you think single or married women make better teachers for elementary grades in public schools?  Do you think that married men should teach in elementary grades?\" answer reads: \"Logically speaking, it seems that a married woman with children would make the best teacher because she has more responsibility and therefore can handle the kids better...A man is not qualified to teach elementary grades, well, because this is a woman's job.\"",
