A1 with question: \"Do you think children should be given 'allowances' (money)? If so, for what reason or reasons (just to have spending money or for chores done around the house, etc.)?  Do you think that it helps or hinders the development of the youngster?\" answer reads: \"I do.  It trains them to manage and to handle their affairs.  Besides training, it may also prevent stealing.  The children receiving the allowances should have to do chores...In the future, the handling of the allowance will enable the child, when he is grown, to better conduct business and domestic affairs.\"",
