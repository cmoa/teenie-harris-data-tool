	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Frances Reedy, 3367 Wichita Street, Hill District, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"I don't think that the congregation should keep a minister entirely. The minister should get out and make money himself.  I think that the congregation should pay his salary, but it shouldn't furnish him an apartment rent-free.  In receiving a salary, the minister should be able to pay his rent.\"",
