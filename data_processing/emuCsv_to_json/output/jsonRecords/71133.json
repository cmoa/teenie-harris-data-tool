McIntosh, heavy equipment operator, Uptown, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 20, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you believe fares would be lower and service better on trolleys and buses if the city owned and operated these services?\"  Mr. Jones' answer reads: \"I don't know whether or not the fares would be cheaper and the service better, because Pittsburgh is a racket town.\"  Mr. McIntosh's answer reads: \"In Philadelphia, Washington, and other cities throughout the country, the fares are cheaper.  So therefore, I think that if Pittsburgh like the other cities operated the trolleys and buses, the rates would be cheaper.\"",
