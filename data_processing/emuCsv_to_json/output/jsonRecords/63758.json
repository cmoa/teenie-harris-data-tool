If you believe that it is taught do you think that the teaching of it is increasing or diminishing?  If so, by whom do you think that it is taught?\" answer reads: \"Racial prejudice in children, in my opinion, is taught rather than inherited.  I think that it's taught by the parents and I think that perhaps it is increasing because of the trouble concerning school integration in the South.\"",
