	"CatDescriptText": "James Bridges, mill worker, 629 Herron Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, April 4, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that theatrical productions like 'The Green Pastures,' which 'take-off' on religions, should be presented as entertainment?\" answer reads: \"I think that it is all right to present religious take-offs as entertainment. This means of portraying them gives the children a chance to learn more about religion and the Bible.  However, there are some scenes which I did not like in 'Green Pastures.'  I especially did not like the race acting showing Negroes clowning and in other acts which some people probably will say are typical of the way Negroes act.  'The Green Pastures' would be real good if it were more like 'Ten Commandments'.\"",
