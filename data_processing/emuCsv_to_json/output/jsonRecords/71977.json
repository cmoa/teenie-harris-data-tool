	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Ernest Miller, postal clerk, Shadyside and Mr. Tony Scotchell, Brushton, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 16, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think the so-called 'store-front' churches, and those who are known generally as 'self-styled preachers,' are an asset or a liability to the community.\" Mr. Ernest Miller's answer reads: \"I think they are assets.  The small churches can get just as much over to the people as the large ones.  By having congregations, the people are able to get together and know each other better, and the minister gets to know the congregation much better than the minister of a larger congregation.\" Mr. Tony Scotchell's answer reads: \"A liability, because they are insincere, and just putting on a show for the people.\"",
