Does he have any power? Does he exert his power?\" Mr. Panill's answer reads: \"No, I don't know the ward chairman.  And to my knowledge, he doesn't have any power.  But I must add that I've been sick and haven't been able to get around much.\"  Mrs. Brown's answer reads: \"No, I don't know the ward chairman.  The reason is that I haven't been in politics.  Whoever he is, he probably does not have any power here because this is a Democratic ward.  There are only about a dozen Republicans here.  I'm more, much more, interested in Cleaves Temple CME Church than I am in politics.\"",
