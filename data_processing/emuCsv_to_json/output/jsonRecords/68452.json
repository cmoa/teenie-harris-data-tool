A1 with question \"What role, if any, do you think the United States should play in the present South African situation?  Do you think United Nations' intervention is enough?\"  Mr. Belines' answer reads: \"We have no jurisdiction there, but we could do something by freeing the people here in the South...UN action should be stronger.  The organization should really put its foot down and let South Africa know that the treatment of the colored people there is inhuman.\"  Mr. Webber's answer reads: \"Yes, the Government should step in, in some way that will not bring on war.  I  think that UN action is strong enough.\"",
