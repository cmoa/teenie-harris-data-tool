A1, with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\"  Answer reads: \"Yes, they do.  They have a lot of influence in politics.  By reporting on the various candidates, they help the reader choose who is the best... The press is just as free today as it was before.  Nobody stops a newspaper, from printing what it wants to print.\"",
