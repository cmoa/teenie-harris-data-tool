Tillery, parking lot manager, 14th Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, May 19, 1962, pg. 9 with question: \"Do you think that, eventually, the City of Pittsburgh will come to include the outlying suburbs under a metropolitan plan of government?\"  Mr. Karkalla's answer reads: \"Some day it will probably happen.  They might as well unite.  It would be a good thing.\"  Mr. Tillery's answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  I doubt that this city would be able to join up with and to get along with other cities like Duquesne and all.  Could happen though.\"",
