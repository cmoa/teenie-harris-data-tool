	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Clara Latimer, housewife, South Hills, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 5, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"If you were advising a Negro high school student, who plans to enter college and is seeking help on choosing a vocation, what field would you suggest that he or she seek as a vocation?\" Answer reads: \"First, one must feel oneself equal to a task, and have the ability to achieve it.  It is difficult to say what a given student should attempt to do, because you have to like your work to be successful.  My suggestion is that a student should be adapted to a career that relates to personal skills and gifts.  God created us all equal, and we all pay taxes.  Let our chances and opportunities also be equal.\"",
