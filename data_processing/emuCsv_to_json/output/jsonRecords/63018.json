	"CatDescriptText": "James Davis, shipper, 23 Trent Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 31, 1959, pg. 32 with question: \"Do you believe in capital punishment? If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  I think that if an extremely bad crime is committed by a person in his right mind, he should be prosecuted to the limit of the law.  However, I do not think that persons under 21 years of age should be subjected to the death penalty.  Sometimes the background of a child has a lot to do with the crime.  If the youth, convicted of such crime which results in a first degree murder conviction, had been brought up the way he should have been, well, things may have been different.\"",
