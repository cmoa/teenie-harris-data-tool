	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Dolly Sanders, housewife, of 2131 Waring Count, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 17, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that American citizens should receive Russia's first deputy premier, Anastas I. Mikoyan hospitably, or deport themselves in unhospitable fashion like some have done in several cities where Mikoyan has visited?\" answer reads: �I don�t believe that we should abuse him. You shouldn�t do that to anybody who is away from home.  In the situation, I think that the Golden Rule should be applied.  We don�t want to be mistreated in Russia so therefore we should not mistreat him.  Perhaps in that way, we will be able to better know him and Russia, and in that way, learn the ways and means to work towards a better peace.�",
