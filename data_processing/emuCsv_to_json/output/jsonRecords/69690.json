A1 with question: \"Do you think there is immediate danger of a third world war? Why? If so, whom do you think our allies will be?  Mr. Prentice's answer reads: \"I can't say, but I hope we are not in any danger.  I hope that they come to some kind of an agreement.\"  Mr. Whitney's answer reads: \"No, because if war started, it would mean the end of the world.  The Russians know it the same as we do.\"",
