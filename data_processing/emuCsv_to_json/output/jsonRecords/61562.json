Primas, 6548 Deary Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 22, 1958, pg. 3, with question: \"Do you think that there will be an economic depression in near future like the one in the early thirties?\" answer reads: \"I certainly hope not. I'm a Republican and for that reason alone I hope not.  I don't think that things will become as tough as the economic situation in the '30s.  For one thing, we have learned some methods to halt a depression from living through the experiences of the '30s.\"",
