Carney Post 46, Veterans of Foreign Wars, will reorganize the famous Carney Post Band shown above. The Carney Post Band, in years gone by, was an outstanding feature of most parades in the city of Pittsburgh and gave many band concerts at the Carney Post, the Aspinwall and Deshon Veterans Hospitals and at other affairs. Some of the former members of this band, shown in the picture above, have gone on to other duties. For instance, Joe Penn and Dave Page are now with the Lionel Hampton band. Other members of the band are with the U. S. Army's band training unit at Fort Lee. During World War II, many members of the Carney Post Band joined the Pennsylvania National Guard band unit which later became the 432nd U. S. Army Band, with Floyd Fitch, who had been the Carney Post Band's director as its Army commander. Now all former members of the band or any veterans with musical ability, or any capable young musicians are requested to contact the organizer or the conductor. Warrant officer Floyd Fitch, U. S. Army Reserve, will serve as conductor. The Carney Post membership and their commander, Cornelius West, have authorized J. Voyle Parker to reorganize the band. Mr. Parker can be contacted at 446 Morgan Street or at MUseum 2-4370. Conductor Fitch can be reached in the evenings at COurt 1-2810. Both can be contacted personally Sundays from 2 to 4 P. M. at the Carney Post Home, 609 Duff Street, or at MUseum 2-9810. - Harris Photo.\"",
