Howard Spencer, 41 of 925 Bryn Mawr Road, is back in news again this week, following his arrest when three policemen broke up a vice ring, which was using cab drivers as 'chauffeurs,' last week-end. Ten men and three women were nabbed.  Spencer, who, together with the late Frank Sneed, small-time personal shepherd of the nocturnal sisterhood, figured in the 'Mystery Mansion' case of two years ago, was 'fingered' by the girls as having played a part in the 'ring.'  They said Spencer called them to his plush sin den, located in 'Scotch and Soda Highlands,' Upper Hill District, when he had 'customers' and also rented them rooms in the lush bordello when the cab drivers brought them to their dates to that address.  He admitted renting rooms to the girls.  Spencer, who was fined $1,000 and placed on four years probation on Oct. 3, 1952, after he had been found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and two other morals charges, was held for court on morals charges again this week, as were the other twelve suspects.
