	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs. Arlene Ketchum, 2516 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 31, 1957, pg. 2 with question: \"Who is your ward chairman? Does he have any power?  Does he exert it?\" answer reads: \"I've been living here four years and don't know who he is mainly because he doesn't come here to get my vote.  However, I do know the Democratic ward chairman because he does come to get my vote.  The Third Ward Republican ward chairman of the area where i used to live, not only registered me to vote, but on each election day saw that I got to the polls.  I notice at the polls here that it seems as though they don't want to fight.\"",
