Yates of 33515 Beechwood Boulevard claims he was wearing the night Miss Ann Graham, white, 21, charges he attacked her as she was on her way to a neighborhood grocery. Note the shoe on the right with the built-up heel, making it higher than the shoe on the left.  Because of an accident, some years ago, one of Yates' legs is shorter than the other, causing him to walk with a noticeable limp.  However, Miss Graham made no mention of her attacker as having limped.  Instead, she said he \"fled\" after she kicked him in the groin.  All of Yates' shoes have the same design-one heel higher than the other. - Harris Photo.\"",
