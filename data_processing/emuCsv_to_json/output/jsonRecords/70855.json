	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Kenneth Smith, funeral director, Mercer County and Richard C. Schielhauf, life insurance salesman, Bethel Park, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 12, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"What do you think about Negro political leadership at local and national levels?  Does it carry 'weight' among Negroes or white people or both?  Why?\" Mr. Kenneth Smith's answer reads: \"I think it has weight among both, because we're all equal.\"  Richard Schielhauf's answer reads:  \"Negro leaders, like Dr. Bunche and others, are taken at face value without reference to the face...People tend to listen to others who speak with sensibility...Sensible Negroes pay attention to sensible Negro politicians.  Ignorant whites pay attention to ignorant white politicians, like in the South.  It's hard to guage [sic] the weight carried by Negro politicians.\"",
