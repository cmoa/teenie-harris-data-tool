Lee, oil company goodwill salesman, Homewood and Louise Snowden, housewife, Terrace Village, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up series published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 20, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes today, in Pittsburgh, are prone to follow Negro leadership in politics or do they consider it ineffective?  What do you think about their attitude nationally?\"  M.T. Lee's answer reads: \"They consider it ineffective, because they believe that most of the political leaders give the impression that they are seeking personal gains rather than working for the good of all.  They are not willing to make personal sacrifices as long as they are gaining.  As for the attitude of Negroes toward national leaders, I think it's favorable, because these leaders don't go for personal gains.  Perhaps this is because most national leaders already are made adn that makes the difference.  And maybe this fact is why local Negro leaders are like they are. There's an old saying that 'first you have to take care of yourself before looking out for others'.\"  Louise Snowden's answer reads: \"I think they are.  And Negroes do it on a national scale.\"",
