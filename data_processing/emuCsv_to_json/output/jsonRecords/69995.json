Dorsey, retired social worker, Oakland, Democrat, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, July 9, 1960, pg. A1 with question: \"Whom do you think the Democratic and the Republican parties will choose for their respective presidential candidates? Why?\" Mr. Maultsby's answer reads: \"Kennedy, because he is a young man with young ideas of the type which the country needs.  Another reason is because it is time that people overlook religion, and vote for the candidate strictly on his qualifications.  As for the Republicans, they probably will choose Nixon.\"  Mr. Dorsey's answer reads: \"Kennedy, because he is the most logical man.  The Republicans will choose Nixon, because they think that there's nobody who can beat him.\"",
