	"CatDescriptText": "Mack Johnson, 2325 Wylie Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1 with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" answer reads: \"I'm strictly a Whitesox man.  As for the Pirates, I don't know what is wrong with them.  They are doing a lot of throwing away of games.  They have some good players.  Some compare with the best in league.  To me, they should be using Stevens instead of Kluszewski.  I don't think that the latter's back will hold up and he can't hit when it is needed.\"",
