	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Vivian Thomas, 279 Dornestic Street, North Side, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"Yes, the minister should be paid a cost-of-living salary because he has to live the same as we do. However, I think that if he is paid a respectable salary, he should be able to pay his rent.  I think that the minister is entitled to a paid vacation.  Otherwise he probably wouldn't have a decent time.  If his salary is not very much the minister should be given special 'gratuity days' to help out.\"",
