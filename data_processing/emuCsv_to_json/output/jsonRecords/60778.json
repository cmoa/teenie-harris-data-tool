A1 with question: \"Do you think that parents should be imprisoned for the unlawful acts of their children (under 18 years of age)?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think that parents should be imprisoned, but I believe that there should be some kind of discipline. In putting the children in a juvenile detention home, the authorities should find the parents and given them a warning.  Then it should be up to the courts to take the necessary action toward the parents because a lot of kids are neglected so far as the parents are concerned.\"",
