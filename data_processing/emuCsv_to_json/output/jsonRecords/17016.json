The business can be identified by the neon sign in the window \"Home Cooked Meals\" partially visible in this view, and the distinctive curvilinear ornament on the windows.  On the counter are miniature juke-boxes, bottles, ash trays, and shot glasses.  Opposite the counter are upholstered booths with tables.  The counter man hands a customer a small item, possibly a matchbook.  The wall paper is an abstracted leaf and acorn pattern.",
