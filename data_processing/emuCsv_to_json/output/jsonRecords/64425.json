Meyer, senior staff assistant, Bell Telephone Company, 3739 Beechview Blvd, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, November 14, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the Federal Government should provide financial aid for students of exceptional ability to further their education when the students are unable to do so for themselves?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't agree that there should be a subsidy, because the ultimate end is greater cost and less value because of getting something for nothing.
