A1 with question: \"Do you believe Negroes, who get public assistance, do more cheating than whites?\" answer reads: \"The way I see it, it doesn't make any difference what the person's race is. If a person is down hard enough, he is going to cheat the government in order to live.  I think that so far as race is concerned, as many of one race cheat as much as the other.\"",
