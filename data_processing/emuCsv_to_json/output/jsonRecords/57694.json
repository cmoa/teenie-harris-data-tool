Veney, left, now 66, of 123 West Twelfth Street, Homestead, chats with John F. (Freyl) Alexander, right, 78, of 215 West Fourteenth Street, Homestead, about a 1910 meeting which they say started the immortal Homestead Grays. Alexander recalled that the meeting was held at his present home and he was elected president.  Veney, whose brother Jerry was the first manager, recalls his playing days which he pointed out were climaxed in late twenties when he handed the Grays' catching chores over to the inimitable late Josh Gibson. - Harris Photo.\"",
