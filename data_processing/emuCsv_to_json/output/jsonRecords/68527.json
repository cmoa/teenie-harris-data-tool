An example is the recent announcement of the rubbish pick-up, which will not reach the Fifth Ward until Aug. 11, the Third Ward until Aug. 17 and the 12th and 13th Wards until July.  The Courier found that one of the city's worst \"hokey\" piles is the one shown in left photo, located in the Fifth Ward in the Francis St. sector below Bethel AME Church.  Residents say the filthy heap is continually growing because junk dealers use the land island for their sorting grounds.  Valuable junk is taken away, while unsellable stuff is left behind.  One resident said: \"If you value your life, you won't say anything to any of the junk dealers.\"...-Harris Photos.\"",
