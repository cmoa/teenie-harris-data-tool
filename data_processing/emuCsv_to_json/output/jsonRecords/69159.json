Quivery, railroad employee, Blackridge, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, June 10, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that the 'Freedom Riders' should accede to Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy's request for a 'cooling-off' period in their program to test segregation laws of certain Southern states?\" Dennis Dahlem's answer reads: \"No, I do not see anything wrong with continuing with the 'Freedom Rides.'  There should be no cooling off.\"  E.E. Quivery's answer reads: \"It seems to me that it would be sensible to cool off a while.  There's no question that they have won their point.  I don't see any point in stirring up so much trouble.\"",
