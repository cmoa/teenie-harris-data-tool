A1, with question: \"Do you believe churches of any denomination receive appreciation financial help from racketeers?\" Answer reads: \"Indirectly, they receive a certain amount because there are always going to be church members who are indirectly involved in the rackets. However, I would say that in colored churches the amount is not great because there are not many people in such positions to give the help.\"",
