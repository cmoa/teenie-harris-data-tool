A14 reads: \"Pittsburgh Gay Northeasterners \"Bubble\" - Champagne bubbled and sparkled and sang from beginning to the end of the cocktail-champagne party given Sunday by Pittsburgh Gays. The posh home of Dr. and Mrs. Edward Hale virtually danced to the tunes of Bobby Jones' organ and tip-toed through riotous spring blossoms, while more than one hundred fascinatingly chic feminine guests and their mates sank happily into a bubbling sea of wine.  Gays swishing madly through the Hale home, laden with jonquils and other spring blossoms, touched an enchanted spark to a most un-spring-like season.  Here, for your pleasure, are Pittsburgh Gays.  Front: Miriam Bush, Agatha Simms, Fannie Knott, Eleanor Jones, Eloise Page, Marion Holmes, Berne Milai and Mary Abbie Session.  Second row: Mabel Waddy, Margaret Jane Smith, Jayne Shelton, Easter Little and Maxine Whedbac.  Going up the stairs: Barbara Hale, Thelma Allen, Elizabeth Henderson, Evelyn Johnson, Wilnette Young, Mary McEinheimer, Julia Gaines and Hellen Prattis.  Thelma Allen is proxy and Mary Abbie Sessions is social chairman.  The guests bowed in direction of Mecca and thanked Allah for the lift of spirits, so far dampened by the dampest April in years. - Harris Photo.\"",
