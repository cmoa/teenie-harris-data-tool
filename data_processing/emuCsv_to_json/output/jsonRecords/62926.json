A1 with question: \"Do you think that permitting children to work after school hours is detrimental to their general welfare--Health, school, and recreational time, etc?\" answer reads: \"I don't think so. However, it depends on the type of work which I think should be suitable.  Some of the work, like the heavy type, is no good for the kids, while other jobs like soda fountain work, delivering papers, and working at a drug store, are all right.\"",
