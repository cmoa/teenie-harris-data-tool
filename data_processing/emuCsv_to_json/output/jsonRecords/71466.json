	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. David Richards, salesman, Bellevue and Mr. A. Stephen Miescer, musical composer, Third Ward, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 4, 1961, pg. 10 with question: \"Do you think that there is any need for building bomb shelters?  If so, who should build them--the individual citizens or the Federal Government?\" Mr. David Richards' answer reads: \"Personally, I'm not too worried about bomb shelters...but, I think it's an individual choice.  I'm for free enterprise, also, and feel that the government already is in our lives too much.  A lot of money should be spent for defense, and not for welfare programs which are missing their point.\"  Mr. A. Stephen Miescer's answer reads: \"We're never going to have atomic warfare, in my opinion.  Like Richard Rodgers, the composer, I believe when people fear certain things, then they are more apt to happen, and especially if we don't trust in God.  We should have the utmost faith in God.  If the goodness of Khrushchev and Kennedy are prevailed upon, we are never going to fight.\"",
