	"CatDescriptText": "Lucille Kennedy, 128 Wooster Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 18, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you think that refuse drivers and collectors should be tipped at Christmas time? Is service affected if they are not?\" answer reads: \"I think they should be tipped if they give us the right service.  They empty the can and don't care whether or not they leave half the rubbish.  By the time you finish picking up the rubbish, the cans are full again.  They don't do this in white sections and I think they would get a tip, a nice tip, if they treat us the same.  We are free hearted and more liberal than white people are.\"",
