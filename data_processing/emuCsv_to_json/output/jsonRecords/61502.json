Walton, 441 Burrows Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 11, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you believe youngsters in their early teens, that is from 13 to 16 years of age, should be permitted to smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages?\" answer reads: \"I definitely do not believe that these things should be permitted.
