	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Fred Pryor, delinquent bill collector and musician, Homewood and Mrs. Harriett Beal, dental assistant, Los Angeles, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 3, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that in custody cases a child should be awarded to the mother, even though she may be of questionable background?...Or do you think they should be placed in a foster home, with visiting privileges being granted to the parent?\"  Mr. Pryor's answer reads: \"I think they should be put into a home, because that way they will receive more attention.  The parents should be permitted to visit the homes.\"  Mrs. Beal's answer reads: \"It's hard to say, because if any woman gives birth to a child, she wants the child.  For somebody to come and just deliberately take away a child, I don't think this is fair.  I have a deep feeling for people who adopt and care for children.\"",
