	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Charles McGill, 309 Cola Street, Mt. Washington, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 13, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"What do you think of young men or boys who process their hair? Do you think it improves their appearance or not?\" answer reads: \"It does not improve the appearance. In fact, I think that it disturbs the natural growth of the hair.  And I'm pretty sure that those persons with processes will find that their hair is gone when they reach the age of 45.  I've noticed that the hair of persons, who have processes, has all the  natural color completely gone.  My son recently became aware of the fact that the process is no good for him.  Before he went into the service, I couldn't do anything to talk him out of having his hair processed.  But after returning from the Marine Corps, where they cut off most of his hair, he has found out that his hair is much better, without being processed.\"",
