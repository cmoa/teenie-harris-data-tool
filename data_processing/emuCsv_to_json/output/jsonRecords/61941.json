What do you think of that which exists?\" answer reads: \"I think that Negro leadership is gradually becoming an effective force, but it can be improved quite a bit.  For one thing, we should have more than just one colored judge.  Also, I think that we should have more colored representation in the Legislature from this area.  That is, more qualified colored similar to Atty. K. Leroy Irvis, whom I think will be elected soon and who is a good leader.\"",
