	"CatDescriptText": "Charles Potter, college student, Lawrenceville and Stephanie Shelton, radio station employe, Schenley Heights, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, May 19, 1962, pg. 9 with question: \"Do you think that, eventually, the City of Pittsburgh will come to include the outlying suburbs under a metropolitan plan of government?\"  Mr. Potter's answer reads: \"Yes. Actually it's not a question of whether or not it will happen, since its something that can't be stopped, according to present trends.  Of course, there would be advantages and disadvantages.\"  Ms. Shelton's answer reads: \"Personally, I would like to see Pittsburgh expand further, that is if these outlying areas could be kept on a nice residential basis, as so many of them are now.  It shouldn't be just to build new factories out in these sections.  The should remain the way they are.\"",
