John Glenn will aid the United States in its relationship with other countries?\"  Ms. Trinclisti's answer reads: \"I imagine it will help by giving people more confidence in the United States.  Also, I think it will help us in dealing with Russia.\"  Mr. Williams' answer reads: \"I don't think it will build our prestige too much.  The competition is too keen - there are so many countries involved in this business.\"",
