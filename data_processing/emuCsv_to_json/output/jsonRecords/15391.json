	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. T.C.Foley, Better Business Bureau of Pittsburgh, Dormont, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 5, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"If you were advising a Negro high school student, who plans to enter college and is seeking help on choosing a vocation, what field would you suggest that he or she seek as a vocation?\" Answer reads: \"We should not ask a youngster to attempt the study of medicine, simply because the nation needs more doctors.  A kid has to suit his aims to his needs and personal ability, the youngsters should be analyzed, to find where their potential lies.  A youngster, who dislikes hospitals and association with the sick or ill, in my opinion, should never become a physician, and certainly can never make a good one.  The mere need of a certain type of student or scholar does not mean that any student can fill the bill.\"",
