Someone stands to profit other than the working man.\"  Mr. Edwin Huminski's answer reads: \"No, I don't think they should and because of the simple fact that this is a free country and businessmen should have a free hand to do what they want.  Competition would take care of the prices...There should be a hands-off policy.\"",
