	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Charles Morrison, steel worker, West End, Pittsburgh, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 26, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In your opinion, what effect on the community do interracial churches have? Do you believe this type of membership should be encouraged?  Why?\"  Answer reads: \"I've had no contact.  It seems there is no effect.  I don't think it hurts.  I've seen quite a lot of colored Catholics attending the downtown church and it seemly makes no difference.  And it should make no difference in Protestant churches.  I'm no authority as to whether or not it should be encouraged.  Let the people go to whatever church they want to.\"",
