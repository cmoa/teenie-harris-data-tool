A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"Yes, that's the night that you can go out.  As for Sunday sales, I think that it's silly not to have them.  Why be hypocritical about this thing?  Alcoholic beverages are sold all week long during the six days, so why not sell them on Sunday, also?\"",
