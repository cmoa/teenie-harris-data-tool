Elder Walter R. Shields, standing on the edge of the pool, raises a hymn as the candidate emerges from the water.  Elder C. J. Nickolson of Selma, Ala., preached; Elder Irene Jackson is minister in charge.  The scene of happy worshipers surrounding the baptismal pool brings fond memories to others who passed this way. - Harris Photo.\"",
