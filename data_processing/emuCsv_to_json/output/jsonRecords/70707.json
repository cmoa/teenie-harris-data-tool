Schmidt, postal relations man, Pleasant Hills, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, January 21, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think students are learning as much under the modern methods of teaching in public schools than students did years ago under the 3 R's (the old teaching method)?\" Miss Nila Velar's answer reads: \"I have a 12 year-old brother and some of the things he comes home with are ridiculous.  For instance the other day he brought home a little story, a jivy story about hep cats.  I asked him where he got it and he said in class during part of his rest period.  I don't think this is the exception but goes on all the time.  The '3-R' teaching method was better.\"  Arthur E. Schmidt's answer reads: \"I don't think they learn as well.  They are learning more things.  The scope is larger, but they are not learning the little things, like how to break down a word to spell it.  I wouldn't advocate returning to the old method, but I think they should case up in the speed-up of the methods... My older child, under the old method, was able to retain learning, but the younger children, after about two months, don't remember what they have been taught.\"",
