	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Stowell B. McKann, student, Mt. Lebanon and Mr. Robert B[e]acon, student, Penn Hills, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 9, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"In your opinion, what do you think is the most effective protest medium Negro people have today?\" Mr. Stowell McKann's answer reads: \"I'm all for the protest movement, but against freedom rides.  I don't think the freedom rides began in the minds of the participants, because I read where the instigators of them went to Cuba, where they were instructed, and the instructions were Communists.  The colored man should work towards equality through education, because without an education, how can you be thought of as equal in the minds of the proletariat, the common man.\"  Mr. Robert B[e]acon's answer reads: \"I think discrimination should be done away with.  But, actually, the Negroes don't have too much to gain by protesting because they put the white man much higher.  In fact, today, the Negro doesn't have too much of a protest medium.  There should be more Negroes in politics, and that way they would have more to say.\"",
