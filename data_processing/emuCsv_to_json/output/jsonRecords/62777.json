A1 with question: \"Do you think common-law marriage should be outlawed?\" Answer reads: \"If I had my way, I would break up everyone living in a common-law marriage arrangement. Such things are a ruination of the young.  In my hometown of Tuskegee the people did not associate with anyone living common-law.  I think that those persons living that way should be driven out of town.\"",
