	"CatDescriptText": "Roxanne Earley, housewife, 150 Bonifay Street, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 24, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that the increasing demand for father and mother to work, thus taking both parents out of the home for the better part of the day, affects their children as regards discipline, ambition, and social compatibility in general?\" answer reads: \"I think that it depends on the family, the child and the kind of background.  Sometimes it is absolutely necessary for both parents of families of our race to work in order to have a well-adjusted family life and to take care of the things which are necessary for the children.  I don't think that it makes the child feel incommitible [sic], that is if the reason for working is a good one and it is explained to the children.\"",
