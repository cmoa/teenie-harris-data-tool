Kreber, salesman, Glenshaw, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, October 8, 1960, pg. 33 with question: \"In your opinion, which political party, Republican or Democratic, has the best record of keeping its campaign pledges to the people of the United States?  Which party do you think would be most successful in carrying out its 1960 campaign platform-this being a Presidential election year?\"  Mrs. Welcher's answer reads: \"I can't say...Neither has done good for us, and neither talks the truth.\"  Mr. Kreber's answer reads: \"Neither keeps pledger well...Ike promised to cut expenses and now they're worse...Nixon would better live up to his 1960 campaign platform.  The Republicans have not made a lot of crazy promises like the Democrats have.\"",
