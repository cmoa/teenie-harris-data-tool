A1 with question: \"Do you think that students are getting adequate vocational counseling in the schools these days? Do you have any suggestions for increasing or improving it?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think so.  And I think of the case of my boy, who was graduated from Allderdice [sic] High School and then went to the University of Pittsburgh and, after one year there, went into the Air Force.  If he had received good counseling in high school, he would have completed his education and then have gone to the service afterwards.\"",
