The 25-year-old officer-pilot, wearing the Air Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster is back from Italy, where he flew 101 missions with the 99th Pursuit Squadron.  Included in the celebration was a colorful parade and an open-air program.  A $500 War Bond was given Captain Wiley by Mrs. Robert L. Vann, for The Pittsburgh Courier and friends.
