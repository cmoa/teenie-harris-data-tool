That one Bucco is 'Bullet Bob' Veale, posed above for a Courier cameraman.  Bob fanned 15 for a new record, two weeks ago, and (with 229 strikeouts at press time) is the lone Bucco ever to fan more than 200 men in one season.  Only Bob (2.92) and Al McBean (2.03) held rival teams to under 3.00, during 80 or more innings, this season.\"",
