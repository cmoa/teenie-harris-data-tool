They let other people speak for them.  The reason is because although we are educated, well educated in many cases, we really haven't go together like other groups.\"  Mr. Prichett's answer reads: \"I think we should choose our own leaders but we don't, and the reason why is, because we have only a few real good leaders.\"",
