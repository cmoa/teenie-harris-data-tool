A1 with question: \"In the coming November elections, do you think voters should elect another Democratic Governor or change to a Republican?\" Selma Scott's answer reads: \"I think that they should elect another Democrat. Thee reason is that this party has done more for the people.\"  Viola Sharp's answer reads: \"We want Lawrence for Governor.  I like Lawrence.  The reason that the Democrats should remain in that office is because that I'm tired of the Republicans because they haven't done anything.\"",
