Responding to the request of Miss Patricia Hays (top left photo), who had discovered his talents, Mr. Hamiel has been painting story-book characters, like those in top left photo.

In the other photos, Mr. Hamiel is shown with some of his other paintings which he explains as \"just puttering around in paint.\" - Harris Photos.\"",
