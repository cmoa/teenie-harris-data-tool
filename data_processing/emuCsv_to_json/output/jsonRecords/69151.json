If so, in what grade do you think they should be taught first?\" Wallace Gaither's answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  I say the courses should be taught around the later years when the children are about 13 or 14 years of age.\"  Mr. Arthur Brunett's answer reads: \"Yes, I think so.  The instruction should begin in the first grade, so it will be welded into their characters.\"",
