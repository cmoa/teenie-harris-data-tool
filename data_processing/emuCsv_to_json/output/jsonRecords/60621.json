If there's too much power in one party, that is not good government.\"  Mrs. Gladys Scott's answer reads: \"I'm not too familiar with politics.  I understand that the offices are all in the hands of one party now and I think that things are pretty good.  I'm satisfied and believe that if things were mixed up they would be worse.\"",
