Well, that's just what one well-known Pittsburgher has going for him... The talented Clifford Morrison, of 850 Delmont Avenue, Beltzhoover, who is possessed with a great amount of creative ability...  Expert Gunsmith - (Lower right) Clifford Morrison is an expert gunsmith.  It is the favorite line of work in his hobby of doing precision machining.  He takes the 'headaches' no one else wants.  One job of tapering and restoration on an antique set of filigree-silver mounted Derringer dueling pistols, valued at $2,700, took five hours of intensive and exhaustive work to complete.  A tapering job on a German Mauser required fifty-six hours of work, the metal having been taken off about a half-a-thousandth of an inch at a time. Morrison is shown with some of the guns he is working on at present. - Harris Photos.\"",
