Do you think such a basis is valid?\" Mr. Cutray's answer reads: \"...Oh yes, I don't think there is however, in this industrial town.  The people just don't have the time to get together, because they are too busy earning a living.  Society is based on money and better living, higher standards of living, and I think these are pretty good reasons for this society.\"  Mrs. Chatman's answer reads: \"...Yes, I do.  And it's based mostly on education ,and I think that this is good.\"",
