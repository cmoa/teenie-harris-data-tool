A1, reads: \"Building Permit Fight - The 19' x 19' x 27' lot (bordered off in left picture), which lies in the buffer zone between the western Negro section and the eastern white section of Stanton Heights; Premier St., is the center of a controversy which continued last week before the city's Zoning Board of Adjustment, over whether or not the building permit should be granted to Stanton Heights builder Joseph Kane. Kane supporters claim that there is opposition to his building because Kane believes in selling property to any qualified builder. The opposition, which included two Negro property owners in a group of whites, maintains that neighborhood property standards and the welfare and safety of the public, not race, are the issue. Zoning board members, questioning Kane as to whether or not he could build the proposed home according to standards, without having it \"hanging into the air\" at the rear of the lot (shown above), said they would personally visit the site before handing down a ruling. Previously, the board had approved Kane's building permit after an engineer appraised the lot and stated that the house could be constructed there on good, solid, shale rock. - Harris Photos.\"",
