	"CatDescriptText": "Margaret Turner, Homewood and Kendall Dillingham, postal worker, Homewood were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, November 19, 1960, pg. C1 with question \"Why do you think Negroes voted so heavily for Senator John F. Kennedy, Democrat, for President, in last Tuesday's election?\" Mrs. Turner's answer reads: \"I believe they voted that way, because they absolutely do not know the facts.  I believe they should have voted differently, and mainly because of the religious issue. There is no doubt in my mind that the new President will be influenced by the Pope.\" Mr. Dillingham's answer reads: \"I think they voted for Kennedy, because the Negro and many other persons are out of work.  And also there's a belief that depressions result when Republicans are in office.  Perhaps the main reason is that the Republicans have done nothing whatsoever for the Negroes during the past eight years.  All they've done is tell the Negro: \"You've never had it so good!\"",
