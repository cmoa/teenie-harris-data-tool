	"CatDescriptText": "Louise Snowden, housewife, Terrace Village, and Billy Hilbert, construction worker, Mahon Street, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up series published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 20, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes today, in Pittsburgh, are prone to follow Negro leadership in politics or do they consider it ineffective?  What do you think about their attitude nationally?\" Louise Snowden's answer reads: \"I think they are.  And Negroes do it on a national scale.\"  Billy Hilbert's answer reads: \"I think there are some Negroes who are worthy of support, but there are a few who seem to sell out.  I think the reason why Negroes in general don't follow their leadership is, because of an attitude concerning this leadership brought on by bad Negro leaders spoiling the confidence which we should have in the good.\"",
