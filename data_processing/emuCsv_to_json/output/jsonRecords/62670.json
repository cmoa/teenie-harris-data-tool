A1 with question: \"Do you think that Sherman Adams was guilty of misconduct in the office of assistant to the President? Do you think that he should have resigned?\" answer reads: \"Sherman Adams has not been proven guilty of any misdemeanor in office and therefore he is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty by a jury of his peers.
