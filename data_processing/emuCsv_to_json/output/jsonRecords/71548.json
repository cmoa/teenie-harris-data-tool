Pastorius, real estate agent, Bethel Park and Rosalie Bentley, domestic, Rochester, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, October 7, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Red China should be admitted to the United Nations?\"  Mr .Pastorius' answer reads: \"Definitely not.  I don't believe this government can recognize two Chinese governments.  Either we're with the Nationalist government or we're straddling the fence.  I feel the Red China government is definitely Communistic.  And our government has spoken out strongly in opposition to communism.  So why recognize a Communistic power?\"  Mrs. Bentley's answer reads: \"Frankly, I haven't given it too much thought.\"",
