Jones was sworn in for a four-year term as City Councilman. Mr. Jones is the first member of his race to become a member of Pittsburgh's law-making body.  He was elected by councilmen in 1954 to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of William H. Davis, present sheriff of Allegheny County.  Last year, Mr. Jones was elected by Pittsburgh citizens in a city-wide vote, running third in a field of four. Mayor David L. Lawrence and Council President Thomas J. Gallagher expressed elated pride in election of Mr. Jones, his courage in facing tough problems and intelligence in their solutions during his first two years of service.  Shown above, being sworn in by Common Pleas Court Judge John J. Kennedy, are Emanuel F. Schifano, John F. Counahan, Mr. Jones and Charles F. Dinan. - Harris PHoto.\"",
