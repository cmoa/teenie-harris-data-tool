If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"It depends on what the person did.  For instance, the death penalty is justified after a very bad murder.  As for youths under 21 years of age, the death penalty should not be imposed because they don't realize what they have done.\"",
