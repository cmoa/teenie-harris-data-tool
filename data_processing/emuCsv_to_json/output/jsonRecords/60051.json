Douglas, Department Store Porter, 1001 Thompkins Run Rd., Monroeville, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 9, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"I do not think that we, as a nation with the tremendous resources of all kinds that possess, are doing anything like our share in carrying out the task of helping the undeveloped countries of the world today.  As proof of this statement, I would refer you to the fact of the amount of aid which the European countries received under the Marshall Plan and what aid we have given to Asiatic [sic], African, Latin American and Southeast Asian countries.  I think it will be quite evident from anyone who makes the comparison between the two, just how much we can, we must, and we should give, but as far as the above named countries are concerned, there is a very serious shortcoming in the amount of foreign aid which we are giving.\"",
