	"CatDescriptText": "Charles McMillian, certified public accountant, Mt. Lebanon and Morris Simmons, unemployed hod carrier, McKees Rocks, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, October 7, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think Red China should be admitted to the United Nations?\"  Mr. McMillian's answer reads: \"I see no reason why we shouldn't because they are a pretty big country.\"  Mr. Simmons' answer reads: \"I believe that Red China definitely controls the China mainland.  So if we are going to recognize China in the UN, we will have to recognize Red China as the leader.  It's unfortunate that they are Communistic.  So far as whether the Nationalists represent China, I fell towards them as I feel towards a statement that the Batista government represents Cuba, when the fact is they don't control the country.\"",
