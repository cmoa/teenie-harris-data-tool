If so, who should mete [sic]  out the punishment-- the teacher or the principal?\" Mr. Alvin Grant�s answer reads: �No, they shouldn�t be whipped.  There should be other penalties used, like sitting in the corner, wearing a dunce hat and other things like the old methods.�  Mr. Nate Smith�s answer reads: �I think that this should be discussed more frequently at Parent Teacher Association meetings.  Some parents believe in shipping while others do not.  I think that it should be down away with until there is an agreement as to what to do.�",
