A1 with question: \"Do you favor an increase in state sales tax or a graduated income tax as a means of raising revenue for a commonwealth of Pennsylvania?\" answer reads: \"I am for the raising of the sales tax because with such a device the state is going to get the money as the people make their purchases.  And another reason is that there is too much being taken now in income taxes.\"",
