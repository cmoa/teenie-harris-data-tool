	"CatDescriptText": "Cutline of related image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 19, 1955, page 16, reads: \"Help Us and Others - The reality that Hill City has succeeded in creating the desire in youngsters to mature and not to degenerate because of criminal activity was shown by Hill City youth officials and members presenting a mock trail in Allegheny County Courtroom of Judge Lois McBride. This hearing started Hill City's drive for $100,000 to be used for a much-needed addition to the present building. The 'trial' was for Tyrone Gober, second from left, who for the sake of a good 'kick-off' for his organization's drive, permitted himself to be the defendant who allegedly assaulted another youngster. Seated on judge McBride's left is Romaine Parham, one of the Hill City judges who have handled many similar but real youth trails, while to her left is District Attorney Alfred Harris, the prosecutor. Defense Atty. Ronald Early, extreme left, listens after he direct-examined the defendant to insure a fair trial. Below is the Hill City band which saluted Mayor David L. Lawrence shortly before the trial's start and after the city executive strongly endorsed the latest effort of the 17-year-old pioneer youth organization by designating Hill City Week.
