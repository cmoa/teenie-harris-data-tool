	"CatDescriptText": "Earl Keys, laborer, 2462 Fifth Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 27, 1959, pg. A1, with question: \"Do you think that newspapers influence public opinion as much today as they did in past? Do you believe that they are 'free' to tell the truth, or do factors like advertising, politics, friendships, etc., influence coverage and presentation?\" Answer reads: \"Newspapers of the past, expressed themselves better and were more down-to-earth.  In the past, when something happened, there were plenty of details, but this is not true today.  In the past, newspapers campaigned.  Today, they don't campaign and are interested, only in selling papers.  Some campaigns of the past which were successful, were those against drunken driving and keeping Pittsburgh clean.  We have no fighting editors today and, therefore, many things are censored....All some influential people need to do to keep something out of the papers is to see the editor.\"",
