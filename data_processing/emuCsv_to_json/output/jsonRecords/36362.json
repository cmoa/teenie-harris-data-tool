Nunn, Jr., son of The Courier's managing editor William Golden Nunn Sr., and Mrs. Nunn, plighted his troth to Miss Frances Bell, daughter of Pittsburgh's socially prominent Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Bell, in one of the year's prettiest weddings. The double-ring rites were read in Bethesda Presbyterian Church, Saturday, Aug. 12, with the Rev. Robert Pierre Johnson officiating... The bride's gown, created by her mother and aunt, Mrs. James Hampton, was designed with a lace bodice and bolero and a sweeping train and skirt of satin. The veil of illusion was attached to a lace Juliet cap, framing the bride's pretty face. A heart-shaped bouquet of white orchids, roses and stepanotis completed the costume. Five charming attendants framed the bride in the receiving line, with the maid of honor being Miss Nancy Reynolds... bridesmaids Doris Haines, Marguerite Dodson, Vivian Mason and Ethel Davis... Patty Gore made a sweet flower girl... William G. Nunn Sr., was his son's best man. Ushers were Gerald Horsley, Richard Britton, Charles Cooper and Neil Humphries... A gala reception, held in the home of the groom, provided the final setting for the momentous day...\"",
