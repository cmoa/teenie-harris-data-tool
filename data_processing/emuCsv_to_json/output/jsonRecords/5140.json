Patterson, the Republicans won their fight to place these posters on billboards throughout the city.  A sort of extra touch is given to this 'artist's conception' by placing in the possession of this sweet little white Evangeline a pop-eyed, black baby doll with bulging red lips.  Although the days of minstrelsy are far behind us, the insulting caricature will undoubtedly cause Mr. 'Tice' Ryan's adherents in the Negro community to wonder they're associating with the right people. - Harris Photo.\"",
