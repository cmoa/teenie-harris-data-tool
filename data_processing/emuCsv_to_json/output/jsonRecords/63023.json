If so, do you  think that it should be imposed on convicted defendants under the age of 21?\" answer reads: \"No.  I have a feeling that you should not take the life of another person.  There's always a possibility that there has been a mistake made in trial, and after a person is dead there is no way in which you can bring him back to life.  As for the deterring effect, I would say that I do not think that it has any effect.  Mankind has been committing murders and killings since the beginning of time, and men have been executed since that time, but still theres crimes are committed.\"",
