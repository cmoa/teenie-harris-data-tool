	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Carl Beckman, student, North Hills and Miss Gloria Ledbetter, student, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 11, 1962, pg. 7 with question: \"What is the best way to end nuclear testing?\" Mr. Beckman's answer reads: I'm sort of an admirer of Bertrand Russell and go along with his theory that what is needed is direct action.  Talking is no good, but what is needed is a demonstration of the courage of conviction.  As far as I'm concerned, the nuclear testing is a suicide race as to who can develop the biggest and best anti-missile-missile.  Russia's industry is geared to the production of weapons so therefore they are not going to sit down at the conference table and talk disarmament.  I suggest that we put pressure on the Congressional leaders and others in order to stop the testing.\"  Ms. Ledbetter's answer reads: \"I think the best way is just for everybody, for every country to just stop the testing.  There would have to be some kind of understanding and mediation because it would be unfair for one country to halt while the other continued the testing.  It should be discontinued because the testing is really stirring up the people who believe that this is preparation which will lead only to war.\"",
