A1 with question: \"Do you think that there will be a steel strike?  Do you think steelworkers are entitled to the raise which they requested or do you think wages should be frozen, according to the argument of the steel industry management?\" Answer reads: \"I do think that there will be a raise but I do not approve of it.  Judging from the fact that the cost of living has soared, I therefore think that they should get a raise.\"",
