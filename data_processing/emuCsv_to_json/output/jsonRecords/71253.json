A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes, when unable to obtain a 'square deal,' in politics, should register a 'protest' vote by voting for Negro candidates on a ticket, or should they utilize other tactics to protest and continue to vote for all candidates who are qualified and will serve their interests best?\" Sidney Johnson's answer reads: \"I think we should vote for those qualified, and not soley because a Negro.  Some Negroes are not qualified, and when elected to office they seem to lean over backwards to please the political bosses in order to keep their jobs...Negroes should vote for the candidate who is backed by the mass of Negroes.  That way, they probably will receive fair treatment...\"  Helen Hayes' answer reads: \"I think we should suport [sic] our race and our won candidates because this gives us a better knowledge by making us stronger.\"",
