Owens, since his great European exploits in track and field has delved into many things from politics to matching strides with a race horse for a winner's purse.  Jesse seems to be pleased with his latest fling at regular employment with the Calvert people; the job appears to be more of less regular and from all indications, the Calvert firm is fortunate in securing a representative so popular and appealing to millions of sepias everywhere.\"Owens won four Olympic Gold Medals at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin in 100-meter dash, the 200-meter dash, the broad jump, and the 400-meter relay team.  In the background, the tail of an airplane, with its registration number NC 13359, is visible.",
