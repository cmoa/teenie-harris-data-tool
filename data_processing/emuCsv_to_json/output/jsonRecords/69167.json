	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Ted Nejman, trucker, Swissvale and Mr. David Deily, shipper, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 1, 1961, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think ethnic groups (like the Negro people) profit more by voting a straight party ticket, or are there better advantages for them in splitting a ticket?\" Mr. Ted Neiman's answer reads: \"They will be better off if they split the ticket.  If you get certain guys behind the party you put a machine into office, and then there's a clique...I've been voting a split ticket all the time.\"  Mr. David Deily's answer reads: \"It's better splitting the vote.  This should be, because that way one party doesn't get everything.  But the main reason for the split vote is so that the best man can get into office.\"",
