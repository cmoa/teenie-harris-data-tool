A1 with question: \"Do you think that we are spending too much money for foreign aid? Do you think that what we have spent has halted the spread of communism?\" answer reads: \"Yes, and we are getting no reward for it.  We are giving out the aid and getting nothing in return.  There are no paybacks.  And I don't think that it is checking communism.  We've made a lot of foreign loans and they haven't won us a lot of friends.\"",
