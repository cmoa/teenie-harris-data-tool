	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. George Potter, 1243 Warner Street, North Side, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, October 19, 1957, pg. 3 with question: \"Should a church congregation pay its ministers not less than a 'cost-of-living' salary, maintain rent-free (with utilities) living quarters for him, pay for vacations for him and his family (if he has one) and, in some instances, hold special 'gratuity days' in his behalf, also?\" answer reads: \"The congregation should pay a cost-of-living salary to the minister and give him rent-free quarters. However, I think he should pay for his own vacation.  I don't think he should have 'special days'.\"",
