	"CatDescriptText": "Miss Betty Conti, 2642 Glenmawr Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 3, 1958, pg. 1A with question: \"Do you think that the average family spends too much time watching television programs? If so, how has it affected family life?\" answer reads: \"At first, it did, but not now.  The average family now is not affected greatly by television, but has adapted itself to it.  For instance, a lot of families eat their meals while watching television.  I would say that television is not too bad for today's family.\"",
