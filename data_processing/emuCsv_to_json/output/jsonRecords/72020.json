	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Charles Hill, government employee, Bentley Drive and Mr. Carl Banks, furniture store employee, Bentley Drive, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, December 9, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"In your opinion, what do you think is the most effective protest medium Negro people have today?\" Mr. Charles Hill's answer reads: \"It takes a lot of people, meeting in the same place, and agreeing on a plan and carrying it out in order to get things done.  They should either get up a petition or go in person in the form of a picket line.  And I think picketing is one of the best protest means.\"  Mr. Carl Banks' answer reads: \"I think mass meetings, but there should be no violence...I don't think picketing is too good.  They should try to boycott and to petition with legal documents in which it is pointed out just what is wanted and why.\"",
