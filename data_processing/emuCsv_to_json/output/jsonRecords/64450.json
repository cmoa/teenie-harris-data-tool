A1 with question: \"Do you think that President Eisenhower is as popular today as he was when he first was when he first took office?  Why?  Do you think that the fact that he is not running for office will influence the election?\" Miss Jimmee Brown's answer reads: \"Not as popular.  He didn't carry out certain things the people expected.  I can't say much about the coming election.\"  Mrs. Betty Gondek's answer reads: \"I think he is as popular.  I know he is with me...I like him and it is not because of politics...I don't know about the coming election.\"",
