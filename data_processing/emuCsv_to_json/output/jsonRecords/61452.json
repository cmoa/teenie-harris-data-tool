	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Charles Walker, 7609 Mulford Street, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, January 11, 1958, pg. 2 with question: \"Do you believe youngsters in their early teens, that is from 13 to 16 years of age, should be permitted to smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages?\" answer reads: \"No, because if they start that early, they will never grow up to be the right type of adults. They should never know anything about cigarettes, whiskey, pistols, or anything else that will ruin their characters.  They will be better off if they start making things with their little hands, and doing things around the house and studying their lessons to make certain that they get good grades in school.  When they come home, instead of running around, they should do those things which will enable them to grow up to become useful men and women.\"",
