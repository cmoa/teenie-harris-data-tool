	"CatDescriptText": "Grace Oakley, housewife, Houston, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, June 20, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"In warning against attempting to assure the civil rights of Americans by passing \"too many punitive laws,\" President Eisenhower told the recent National Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., that: 'I have little faith in ability of statute law to change human hearts to eliminate prejudice. All we can do is hold the line, and wait for a change in mental conditions.'  What do you think of his statement about the problem?\"  Answer reads: \"I think that laws will help.  Laws are always better if they are passed and can be enforced.  If there is no enforcement, then we have to wait for a change of heart.\"",
