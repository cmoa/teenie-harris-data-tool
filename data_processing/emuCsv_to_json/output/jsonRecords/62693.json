A1 with question: \"Do you think that Negroes should be 'militant' in their fight for civil rights or pursue a course of 'sitting down, talking and seeking a working plan for obtaining them without vigorous pressure?\"  Answer reads: \"In my opinion, the past years have shown that by sitting down we haven't gained too much. As far as I've seen, the militant stands have accomplished more than just sitting down and doing nothing.  Therefore I'm in favor of a militant stand the way in which we gain the most progress.\"",
