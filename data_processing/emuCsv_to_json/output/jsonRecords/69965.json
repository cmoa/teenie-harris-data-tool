A1 with question: \"What do you think is the number one problem for city officials to solve in the redevelopment program?  Why?\"  Mr. Carter's answer reads: \"The greatest need now is better houses, especially for colored people.  At present they are paying high rents and not living in decent places.\"  Mr. Young's answer reads: \"I think that the redevelopers should see that the displaced people have a decent place in which to live.  I mean not only those displaced by the lower Hill program, but also those who will be displaced in the future.\"",
