Chapin, production manager, Wilkinsburg and Mrs. Richard Neal, presser, North Side, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, March 25, 1961, pg. B1 with question: \"Do you think Federal aid to schools should be granted to parochial as well as public schools?\" Mr. Chapin's answer reads: \"I say no.  In the first place, the parochial schools are under the authority of the church.  They were built by the churches and since they are outside of the public school system, I hardly think Federal Government is called upon to give them aid, also.\"  Mrs. Neal's answer reads: \"I think it would be a great thing.  IT would help integration because a lot of Negroes are Catholics.\"",
