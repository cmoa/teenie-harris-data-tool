A1 with question: \"Which of these sources of leadership do you believe Negroes generally follow: church, labor, or politics? Why?\" answer reads: \"In my areas, it is political leadership.  And the reason is that there is more interest among Negroes in politics, and also because they do not go to church but do vote.  I think that they follow politics because of personal reasons.  The people, I'm talking about, are mostly housewives who do not work.\"",
