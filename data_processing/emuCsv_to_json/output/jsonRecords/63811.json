	"CatDescriptText": "Mrs.Mary Patterson, of Greentree was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 18, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think taverns should be permitted to remain open and dispense alcohol beverages until at least 2 A.M. Sundays? Do you favor the sale of beer and wine on Sundays in Pennsylvania, like some other states permit?\" answer reads: \"I think that 12 o'clock midnight Saturday should be the deadline.  And the reason is that to remain open any longer one is encroaching on the Sabbath.  However, I do think that restrictions on Sunday baseball games and other forms of recreation should be lifted.  I'm inclined to hold off on an opinion about the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday.  I think that if the taverns were open on Sunday there would be more of a temptation for people to imbibe.  And I say this not as a non-drinker because I take an occasional drink.\"",
