A1 with question: \"Do you think that business and employment are as good as the Eisenhower administration declares that it is?\" answer reads: \"Well, no, they aren't. But you can't blame the Eisenhower administration for it.  The reason, in my opinion, is because of automation, which is forced onto big business by the demands of the unions.  The Eisenhower administration is not to blame for it any more than the Truman administration.  When the overhead of the businesses is increased by union demands, that cuts the profits and in order to make profits, the businesses put in automation.\"",
