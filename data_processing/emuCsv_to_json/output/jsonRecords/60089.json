	"CatDescriptText": "Rev. James Harris, 623 Herron Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, May 16, 1959, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think Americans are as friendly towards Africans as they should be? Do you think that they lack sufficient knowledge of the country or are of the general disposition to look down their noses at the darker races?\" answer reads: \"No, I don't think that we are as friendly towards Africans as we should be.  And I don't think that we are receiving enough information on Africa.  As for our thoughts about Africans, I think that we have a tendency to hold our heads too high and not to look at the people as we should.  We have some cultured and well-educated Africans who each day are showing themselves to be an asset to America.\"",
