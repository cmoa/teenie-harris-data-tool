A1 with question: \"Do you think the Federal Government should intervene in the student sit-down demonstrations?\"  Mr. Turner's answer reads: \"Yes, I do.  Local governments generally do not have the will and if they do they don't have enough power to investigate.  Politics has more to do with local investigations than with Federal intervention.\"  Ms. Bryant's answer reads: \"I think it should because every year there is something new happening against Negroes.  Federal Government intervention would help to right things.\"",
