Lebanon and Dorothy Staten, machine bonner, North Side, were part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 13, 1960, pg. 29 with question: \"Do you think that married students of high school age should be permitted to attend school with other students who are single?\"  James Stroud's answer reads: \"I don't think so.  It wasn't done when we went to school.  They should wait until they are out of high school.  Things are too fast as they are, and for married persons to be in high school would worsen them.\"  Dorothody Staten's answer reads: \"I don't think so, because of different outlooks on life by single and married youths of high school age.\"",
