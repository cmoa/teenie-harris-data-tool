	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. Douglas Dorsey, school board employee, Los Angeles, was part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, August 12, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"What do you think about Negro political leadership at local and national levels? Does it carry 'weight' among Negroes or white people or both?  Why?\" answer reads: \"We tend to stick together a little more.  But on a whole, we're still relying on the blue-eyed boy.  If we get out of relying on the blue-eyed boy and work harder, we soon will become the first-class citizens which we are.  And if Negro political leaders stick by their convictions and cut the stings with the whites, they will have more respect.  I can't speak for the whites as to what they feel about Negro leaders.  But comments which I've heard from whites reveal an attitude of toleration and not sincere respect.  I've heard whites say that Adam Clayton Powell is a 'good boy.'  This, to me, is not respect but toleration.\"",
