A1 with question: \"Do you think that the hospital service rendered under Blue Cross plan is worth its present cost to the subscriber? Do you think the rates should be raised?  Why?\"  answer reads: \"I really don't know, but I think that the Blue Cross program is a good one, especially for persons who have families.  It is a good safeguard for emergencies.  I don't know about the rate increase, but I might say that in past they have gone up because the hospital treatment has improved tremendously.\"",
