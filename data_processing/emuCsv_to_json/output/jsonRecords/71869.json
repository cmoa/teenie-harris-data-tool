	"CatDescriptText": "Mr. George Thompson, trucker, Crestview and Mr. \"Hap\" Mahon, musician, Homewood, were part of the Pittsburghers Speak Up column, published in Pittsburgh Courier Newspaper, September 16, 1961, pg. 7 with question: \"Do you think that political party policy makers respect the Negro vote and act accordingly, or do they take it for granted?  Why?\" Mr. Thompson's answer reads: \"They just take the Negro vote for granted, with the attitude 'Hurry for me and the h---- to you.'  And when you consider just how many of us are in judgeships, on the police force as lieutenants and in other payroll jobs, you realize that not only do they take our vote but us also.\" Mr. Mahon's answer reads: \"I think that they partially but to a very negligible extent respect our vote.  But this recognition does not lead to aggressive action in the making of policy and the doing of things.  Why is this so?  Well, I think it's because of the ignorance of voters.\"",
