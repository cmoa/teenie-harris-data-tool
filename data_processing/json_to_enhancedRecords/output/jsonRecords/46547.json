The display, sponsored by the Civic Unity Council, was prepared by the staff of the Carnegie Museum, under Dr. James Swauger, curator of man at the museum.  The graphic illustration, the first of four exhibits, deals with the cultural and biological heritage of man.  After being on view for one month, this exhibit will be succeeded by the others.  The exhibit points out the fact that most of the tensions between men can be traced to a person using a racial approach in judging his fellowman.  As a challenge to the viewers, the display has an American hat on each of the three sculptured heads and asks the viewer if he thinks he 'can at least place everyone he meets in one of the three great divisions of mankind.'  Then try it.  Some of its other words are that 'A Nation is Not a Race...A Religion is Not a Race...There is No Pure Race.\"Additional text on display reads: \"But if anyone tells you he can classify any individual...he is not a scientist.  An anthropologist can distinguish groups after laborious measuring.  It's his racket.  You think you can at least place everyone you meet in one of the three great divisions of mankind:  Mongoloid, Caucasoid, Negroid.  TRY IT- We have given each an American hat.
