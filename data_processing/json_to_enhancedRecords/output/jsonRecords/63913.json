Above are five views of damage inflicted by the James squad raiders on August 6, 1958, after they entered through an unlocked front door at 2425 Wylie Ave...

The owner of the confectionary store at 2425 Wylie Ave., Prince Bland, was not present when the raid was started, by clerks and other witnesses, including customers, stated that a search warrant was not displayed - or mentioned.  In addition to cutting the telephone wires in the establishment, the raiders smashed a total of 12 locks, a full-length mirror, destroyed merchandise and cracked plaster in almost every room in the store and apartment.  Most of the damage was done after the officer obtained $600 in cash, some numbers slips and an adding machine, witnesses said. - Harris Photo.\"",
