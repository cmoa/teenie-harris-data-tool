A1 with question: \"Do you think students in the South are using the right technique in protesting segregation in places of public accommodations?\" Harry McConnell's answer reads: \"Anyone attempting to attain a goal and attempting to buck the authorities is always left with the question of which method is best, no matter how much they believe in the principle.  It is the only method, and the most peaceful, and is thoroughly right and justified, and they are to be admired for resorting to non-violence.\"  Dick Gregg's answer reads: \"I think that it will be a very healthy sign when both races use methods like this to ask for equality.  It seems to me that this asking for equality is the most profound request of our younger generation.\"  Revor Melia's answer reads: \"I heard the news that if any one of the demonstrators was expelled from school, none of them would attend.  This seems to be a reasonable way of making a point embarrassing the administration and making it a matter of national interest, which it needs to be.  In general, I support any action which achieves equality, but I'm not certain it did what it was suppose to do because it may have achieve so much antipathy.  Nevertheless, this is a sort of thing I would have done in the same situation.  It is the most effective way.  If the same thing would have happened in Pittsburgh, I would certainly boycott and advocate whites to boycott any of the establishments concerned.\"",
