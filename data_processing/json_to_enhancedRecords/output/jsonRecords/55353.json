Brown reads: \"Some say it's swanky...some say it's terrific...some say it's pretty as a ten-thousand bill...some say it's foxy...but practically everyone says its' the prettiest lounge in East.  The sensational new Crawford Grill Number Two is the rave of Pittsburgh and the way points, and it is by all odds the most popular oasis in the city.  The beauty of the entire job is the fact that no prices have been raised since the spot was remodeled.  The management of Crawford Grill Number Two operates on the theory that people would patronize a beautiful place at popular prices.  A miracle has been wrought in the seven years that the Crawford Grill Number Two opened its doors.  A good, solid clientele had been built up on good service and good food, plus a well-stocked bar, with the CG2 dishing out entertainment in the evenings.  Rather than rest on what had gone before, the management believed in giving its friends some of their money back by dreaming up a first-class room with all the trappings of big-time clubs.  So the men went to work and what came forth looks like a beautiful painting or a dream room.  The Crawford Grill Number Two just must be the last word.  The end.  An efficient staff of twenty-one, under the supervision of Oscar Norwood, serves the fine meals that make CG2 the city's favorite dining room.  Steaks, chops, seafood, short orders and sandwiches are always served quickly and neatly.  Norwood enjoys twenty-nine years of culinary skill and his food proves it.  The well-stocked bar is more popular than ever.  The room is a fine backdrop for Leroy Brown's top music.  The alto sax ace enjoys a long run in the upper Wylie Avenue spot and will better acoustics, Leroy's crew sounds real nice.  He knows how to sell to the crowds that are the rule rather than the exception at CG2.  For those who have not seen the new Crawford Grill Number Two, here is what it looks like: a low, modernistic ceiling of attractive sound absorbent material gives a cozy air.  The booths in the bar section are gay pumpkin red, with the booths in the dining room in restful chartreuse.  The entire layout is air-conditioned.  Beautiful draperies (to be changes every so often) flank the booths in the bar section.  The maddest touch of all is the bronze mural of a band on parade in modernistic figures that march along the wall opposite the new bar.  Then there are the plants that lend a natural aspect to the room.  These plants are so realistic that people actually want to touch them.  The general good taste of the decorations gives the Crawford Grill Number Two an air of quiet splendor that is enhanced by the gold bands at strategic spots in the room.  The dining room motif features a very pretty wall pattern.  Everywhere one looks there is a new, more imposing color scheme to relieve the sameness of the average place.  No one can ever say the Crawford Grill Number Two looks like a store.  It's too pretty and it will stay like it is for a long time.  The B & W Seating Company outdid itself in designing this room, plus erecting a fine new bar with matching stools.  A wonderful job.  The Crawford Grill Number Two uses Meadow Gold products, seafood from the Live Fish Company, meat from Schlosser's, and sausage from Metropolitan.  The place has always enjoyed an A-rating as a food establishment.  Now it is A-plus...\"",
