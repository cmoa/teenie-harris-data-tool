All agreed that 'something's up,' and that 'something' was something BIG.  Of course, all knew.  But all had been sworn to secrecy.  Plans had been in the making for the past nine months and more.  After exchanging additional greetings, we were informed that if we wished, we could go nearby and have a 'bite to eat,' as we had the time.
