Police said Spalding looped at 36-link chain around his neck, twisted his body, and pushed forward.  His feet never left the floor.  Officers said Spalding had smashed his bunk loose from one chain Friday night, had been placed in another cell Saturday, where he broke another chain on that bunk and finally broke the other chain of the same bunk Sunday and committed suicide.  Upper photos, left to right, the powerfully built Spalding during his weight-lifting days; Spalding 'mugged' by police two days after he had been 'subdued and apprehended' by officers, following the gun battle at Fullerton and Hazel Streets; the bullet sprayed walls of the house, some of the bullet holes circled, where Heagy was shot (inside first door) as police laid down a wild 'protective barrage'; and lower photos, left to right, the cell in which Spalding's body was found hanging by a turnkey, with arrow pointing to the loose chain which was wrapped around his neck; inset the broken link which connected the 'suicide chain,' and the arrow in right photo points to the chain which Spalding broke Friday.  A battered tincup [tin cup] was also taken from him Saturday and his shoe laces and belt were removed from him to prevent a suicide attempt, police said. - Harris Photo.\"",
