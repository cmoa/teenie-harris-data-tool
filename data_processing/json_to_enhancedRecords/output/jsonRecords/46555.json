    "CatDescriptText": "Cutline of image published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, February 26, 1955, pg. 5, reads: \"Focus on Humanity - Pictured above are the two sides of an exhibit on display in lobby of the City-County Building as the city celebrates Brotherhood Week. The display, sponsored by the Civic Unity Council, was prepared by the staff of the Carnegie Museum, under Dr. James Swauger, curator of man at the museum.  The graphic illustration, the first of four exhibits, deals with the cultural and biological heritage of man.  After being on view for one month, this exhibit will be succeeded by the others.  The exhibit points out the fact that most of the tensions between men can be traced to a person using a racial approach in judging his fellowman.  As a challenge to the viewers, the display has an American hat on each of the three sculptured heads and asks the viewer if he thinks he 'can at least place everyone he meets in one of the three great divisions of mankind.'  Then try it.  Some of its other words are that 'A Nation is Not a Race...A Religion is Not a Race...There is No Pure Race.\"Additional text on display reads: \"if...you believe you and yours are just naturally better than the other fellow and his, that's nothing new.  The idea is older than history.  Do you believe that you and yours are just naturally better than the other fellow and his?  You have plenty of company..  ...many of the world's primitives think the same thing about themselves.  if you and yours believe that you are not just naturally better than the other fellow and his, perhaps only luckier, you probably have some knowledge, think a little, and have what is called 'humanity.'  These groups exhibit ethnocentricism.  the unreasoned belief that one's on race, nation, tribe, clan, family, religion, school, community, or what-have-you, is the best in the world.  This belief stems chiefly from ignorance.  inexperience, and blind pride.  It seems to be the most natural thing in the world for any group, but it has lead, and will continue to lead to all sorts of trouble among peoples.  It cannot be dreamed away.  IT MUST BE FOUGHT.  And it IS silly, isn't it?\"",
