    "CatDescriptText": "Olivia Carter, 210 Bonifay Street, St. Clair Village, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, September 27, 1958, pg. A1 with question: \"Do you think there is any racial tension in Pittsburgh? in neighborhood where you live?  If so, what do you think causes it?\" answer reads: \"I sure do, most definitely, and if we're not careful we will have another Little Rock situation right here.  And I think that the reason is because there is ignorance on both sides. I really can't pin it down as to what is the reason exactly.  If the older folks leave the young people alone, there won't be any trouble.  My daughter has wondered why the children can't get along and go to school together in Little Rock and other places.  In St. Clair Village, there is always something happening.  To point out that a lot of the tension is caused by ignorance, I recall the case of a colored woman, who is living in St. Clair Village, who had come to Pittsburgh from the South.  She wondered why Negroes and whites lived together in the same apartment house.  She could have created a lot of trouble.  However, we got together and told her that since she didn't like it, to go right back down South where she came from.  She now is waiting for a relative to come to return her to the South.  As for the white people in my neighborhood, I would say that most of them are well adjusted.  One or two of them can't go along with the integration and therefore they stay to themselves.  And there was another incident which happened, after a white woman and Negro woman had an argument.  Shortly afterwards, the colored boy, the son of one of the women, burned up all of the white women's clothes, which were hanging on a line.  YOu should have seen what happened.  The clothes of quite a number of the people, living in the neighborhood were hanging on the line, but the boy chose only the clothes of the woman who had argued with his mother.\"",
