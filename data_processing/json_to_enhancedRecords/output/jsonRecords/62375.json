    "CatDescriptText": "Cornelius Taylor, 2338 Centre Avenue, was part of the \"Pittsburghers Speak Up\" column published in Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, July 5, 1958, pg. 1 with question: \"What do you think is wrong with the Pittsburgh Pirates? Do you think that they are using their best ball players at all times?\" answer reads: \"What's wrong with the Pirates?  Well, I should say that they are not getting the hitting, and they are making too many errors.  They should bench Skinner.  He lost about two games in a row.  For instance, last Thursday night, Vernon Law had the game under control until Skinner dropped the ball in one of the late innings.  They should bench Skinner until he is in good physical condition.  Thomas should be put into left field and Kluszewski kept on first.  Big Klu is coming into his own as shown by the fact that his average soared- in a short time from .240 to .299.  As for using Stevens, I might say that he is a rookie who has no big league experience, and he cannot hit a curve ball. As soon as they found out that he could hit a curve ball, the pitchers were striking him out three out of four times.  At that time, he should have, like the rookie in a Ring Lardner yarn, written to h is mother: 'I'll be home now, Mom, because they are starting to cure the ball'  As for Baker, he is a great utility player, but he can't break into the line-up with the great little Mazeroski around and with Groat around who is always a threat at the bat.  Mejias is a good utility player.  He did good at first out on the Coast, but lately he has been stopped rather easily.\"",
