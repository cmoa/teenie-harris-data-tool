A32, reads: \"Rucker Hysterically Admits Beating Child - Before Court - Before his trial started before Visiting Judge Warren Hess of Berks County, James Rucker, heard Mrs. Leslie Cohen, wife of his defense attorney, attempt to convince Rucker hat the jury would acquit him. - Harris Photo.\"  Portions of accompanying article read: \"...Testifying Wednesday that she looked forward to marrying 26-year-old James Rucker, on trial for beating to death her 5-year-old daughter, Paula, the mother of the victim, this morning (Thursday), whispered briefly from a distance to the defendant during a court recess...  The defense, which started its testimony Wednesday afternoon, placed two leather experts on the stand this morning who testified that the belt used in the whipping was weak from perspiration and could only break from a blow on a inanimate object...  The State is seeking a second degree murder verdict. Prosecutor Silvestri Silvestri said the child's death resulted from malice without intention to take life...  The State alleges that Rucker, angry because the little girl begged food from a neighbor against his (Rucker's) order, 'began spanking the girl on the buttocks with his hand until it stung.' ...Prosecutor Silvestri stated that next 'Rucker removed his 39 inch belt and began beating the girl who was screaming and hollering that she would not do it any more.  The defendant then held the girl by his left hand and beat her in the stomach until the belt broke.  He let go of her and she dropped to the floor.'  Silvestri brought out that the evidence would show that as the girl was dashing from the room to escape the beating, Rucker continued to hit her with his slipper.  The girl's mother, Mrs. Irma Scott, found her daughter when she arrived home from her job at a downtown milkshake bar.  The husband had gone to work.\"",
